Have you ever turned down a promotion/passed on an offer/left a job even though it meant giving up a lot of money? Why? Would you do it again?,"I have several times left a job voluntarily without something else lined up.  I don't recommend that, but I find it really difficult to job hunt effectively when I'm currently in a job that leaves me unhappy.  So I've learned to build up a bit of a stash, then quit and look for work."
Have you ever turned down a promotion/passed on an offer/left a job even though it meant giving up a lot of money? Why? Would you do it again?,"i graduated in may and work in sports. i gave up an offer to work for an nfl team. it would mean makin a lotta money, moving across the country and starting new— sounded great to me! operations was real nice and gave me till near graduation to make a decision w it bc it was after all, a big decision. ultimately didn’t go with it because my anxiety has always been terrible and didn’t feel confident taking up the job right away. especially since it was a big role with the team and not specifically what i want to do."
Have you ever turned down a promotion/passed on an offer/left a job even though it meant giving up a lot of money? Why? Would you do it again?,"Before we were living together, my wife had a job offer for nearly 20k more per year (which, when you make 40k, its hard to say no) but it would have moved her from us being a 8 hour drive away, to a 3 hour flight apart.  For that reason, she ultimately turned it down."
Have you ever turned down a promotion/passed on an offer/left a job even though it meant giving up a lot of money? Why? Would you do it again?,"I was offered a large amount of money to stay in a job with a loud, overbearing jerk boss after I had already negotiated talking my job responsibilities to a new brilliant good boss.  I would do it again any day."
What are some things you would like to see in an Airbnb?,Extra towels and blankets. Truly.
What are some things you would like to see in an Airbnb?,Keurig was a nice touch last time I travelled. I didn’t want to make (and waste) a whole pot but the single coffee in the AM was mint.
What are some things you would like to see in an Airbnb?,"Restaurant recommendations for the area, good WiFi access, clear rules printed out and put in a noticeable place! (Got a parking ticket in Beverly Hills a couple months ago because the printed rules that notified us to park in the driveway overnight were hidden in a binder that wasn’t placed in an obvious spot)."
What are some things you would like to see in an Airbnb?,I would *not* like to see the owner of the house haha but maybe that’s just me being anti-social
What are some things you would like to see in an Airbnb?,A working hair dryer and I'm set.
What are some things you would like to see in an Airbnb?,"Tea, coffee, water bottles/cans, period products, toiletries (shampoo/conditioner/soap), paper towels/napkins, basic cutlery and pots and pans if it has a kitchen, blackout curtains, earplugs/sound machine, WiFi"
What are some things you would like to see in an Airbnb?,"I like to see that the family will leave me alone by default, but is willing to hang out if I want to.

I love alone time, but sometimes I'd like to talk to someone besides the randos at the brewery."
Have you ever turned down a promotion/passed on an offer/left a job even though it meant giving up a lot of money? Why? Would you do it again?,"I've recently passed on a couple of offers that paid more than I'm making now. I currently work from home and have a pretty flexible schedule, and the offers would require me to have a commute of anywhere from 30min to an hour depending on traffic. So, factoring in gas, parking permits, nice work clothes, plus the the required hours (plus the commute that could add up to 2 hours on an 8-9 hour day), we decided that my current situation was preferable."
Have you ever turned down a promotion/passed on an offer/left a job even though it meant giving up a lot of money? Why? Would you do it again?,"I've been told at a couple of my jobs that I would be a good candidate for promotion/management. It wouldn't mean a substantial amount of money, usually, but a pretty good raise with that promotion and of course the potential for further promotions and raises. 

Frankly, I just don't give a shit. More money means more stress and responsibility. Plus workplace politics. I can't be bothered. I like to just come in, do my work with minimal supervision and go home. I also like being able to pass off issues to my manager when it's clearly above my responsibility. 

A lot of this is also motivated by my own mental health. I have several mental illnesses so my main goal in life is to keep myself stable enough to function properly. Sometimes going in and doing my job is difficult, I don't need the added stress of a promotion on top of that."
Have you ever turned down a promotion/passed on an offer/left a job even though it meant giving up a lot of money? Why? Would you do it again?,"Earlier this year. I would do it again, bad employers don’t deserve amazing employees."
What are some things you would like to see in an Airbnb?,"Must have:

- wifi
- privacy. I don't like to chitchat with the owners or eat dinner with them. If possible I'd never see them at all (yay for passcode locks!). I appreciate when an airbnb explicitly states this interaction is a possibility so I can therefore not book those places, lol

Some things that have been in previous Airbnb stays that I loved:

- drawer in the bathroom full of toiletry samples (soaps, floss, toothpaste, etc) that were available for use should guests run out/forget theirs. Also a dispenser mounted in the shower pre-loaded with shampoo, conditioner, and bodywash. Pile of fresh clean towels
- kitchen with some basic essentials (cooking oil, tea bags, seasonings, just the little things you might need but not want to go purchase a lot of for a few nights stay, and pots/pans/utensils) but also one airbnb I was at had a keurig machine with a bunch of free k-cups and my SO loved it, he had a different flavor cup of coffee every morning, haha
- bluetooth speakers, board games, record player and a stack of records, netflix/hulu/whatever login, just lots of entertainment options"

&gt; Im asking women as a guy, some guys look at beasts so what is the opposite for women?

What are some things you would like to see in an Airbnb?,"The best one I ever stayed at came complete with a welcome bottle of wine, a basket of snacks and cold drinks in the fridge. You can always win me over with snacks. It also had a google chrome cast for TV watching."

"If every man had to be a woman for one day, what would you have them do?",Explain something during a meeting full of men
"If every man had to be a woman for one day, what would you have them do?",Go about their day like nothing's wrong while enduring backache and menstrual cramps and wondering if they've bled through their super tampon yet.
What do women look at?,"I look at height first and foremost. Height makes guys double attractive to me. It's shallow but it's my one requirement. Tall and muscle, tall and thin, tall and chubby; either way 6'2 and over lol."
"If every man had to be a woman for one day, what would you have them do?","Walk past a group of men on the street,  get unsolicited dick pics in their inboxes, and be supermom while enduring a heavy period complete with cramps, bloating and hormonal anger. 
:)"
"If every man had to be a woman for one day, what would you have them do?","Go to the gym and listen to all the guys come up and give me advice on ""form"" on my squats."
"Women who are thin but have excess fat in some places (e.g. double chin) that won’t go away, any tips?","That sounds to me like a dental/jaw problem, if you’re not overweight but have a double chin. Perhaps you have an overbite?"
"Women who are thin but have excess fat in some places (e.g. double chin) that won’t go away, any tips?","Could try working on fitness rather than just weight, if you're ""skinnyfat."" Beyond that... Just kinda have to accept your body sometimes."
"Women who are thin but have excess fat in some places (e.g. double chin) that won’t go away, any tips?","Chin fat, there is an injectable option to dissolve the fat there — Belkyra. The rest, if you aren’t in a position to lose weight, basically just either work on fitness to see if you can change body composition, or else just kind of accept it."

What are some things you would like to see in an Airbnb?,"I love when they have netflix, it's a nice touch."
How can a man distinguish between “being friendly” from “I’m really interested”?,"You could always try flirting with them, or just flat out ask them on a date. But if they say ""no"" don't push the topic."

"Women who are thin but have excess fat in some places (e.g. double chin) that won’t go away, any tips?","My body likes to store fat in my upper arms, so even though I have visible abs I’m always fighting bat wings. A trainer finally taught me that working my deltoids can sculpt my arms to where they don’t look flabby, even if that bit of pudge is still there."
How can a man distinguish between “being friendly” from “I’m really interested”?,"If it's their job to be friendly, they are almost certainly not interested. 

If they have a significant other, they are probably not interested. 

If they are that friendly to everyone, they are probably not interested."
What are some things you would like to see in an Airbnb?,Fluffy gowns!
How can a man distinguish between “being friendly” from “I’m really interested”?,"Try to compare how your person of interest treats you with how they treat other people, like mutual friends. If they are a little extra friendly to you, they could be interestes in you as well."

"If every man had to be a woman for one day, what would you have them do?","Anything they want. Their experiences would depend on what kind of woman they were, and their surroundings."
Women who have gone through addiction how did you overcome it?,"My *disgust* with smoking got stronger than my addiction to it. (Basically, I was incredibly disgusted with the smell and the gross slimy cough.)

So far as I understand it, feeling disgusted is a very strong survival mechanism, keeping us from doing unhealthy things like eating putrid food.

So I guess nature saved me in a way.

It still took two tries, because addiction is a scary monster that doesn’t let go easily."
What are some things you would like to see in an Airbnb?,"Key pad, hot shower, private bathroom, WiFi, washing machine and parking space is what I look for. Love when they go above and beyond like stocking the fridge and give local sight seeing suggestions too."
Do you need to see models that look like you in order to want to purchase something online?,"No, but I do want to see it on a person, as opposed just hanging in mid-air."
What's your favorite hobby?,"Dog training. Do your research!! 
Especially on dog body language and behavior."
Do you need to see models that look like you in order to want to purchase something online?,"I'm a size 10-12 (US) so I'm kind of in this weird area between plus size and normal sizes that just makes it really hard to know how something would look on me from the models. I don't think there is ever this ""in between"" shown. 

I don't tend to buy clothes online anyways, with my body type I know is a recipe for failure... but I think I'd prefer to see how it looks on diferent bodies. It's not skinny models that throws me of, but when brands put very... high fashion models, girls that are 6ft and very, very, very slim, also usually in the weirdest poses and make it impossible to really see the clothes (Zara style), I can't do it, it's just impossible to picture myself."
Women who have gone through addiction how did you overcome it?,"I didn't. It's just long-term maintenance, and the urge will always be there, even if it becomes easier to ignore."
Do you need to see models that look like you in order to want to purchase something online?,No but I never want to purchase online anyway.
"If every man had to be a woman for one day, what would you have them do?","They can do what they want, I don't care."
Do you need to see models that look like you in order to want to purchase something online?,"Not exactly like me, but I prefer when the models are not *extremely* skinny. I am already fairly slim, but I just cannot imagine how the clothes would look on me when the models wearing them are practically skeletal.

Edit: I love it when a brand shows the same product on a range of different-sized models."
Do you need to see models that look like you in order to want to purchase something online?,"Buying clothing anywhere is just an impossible task since I'm ""plus sized"" and tall (6ft) with a giant wing span. So even though they have the plus sized models and ""philosophy"", actually trying on anything is usually disappointing.

So I buy men's tshirts and pants instead to feel better about it. Due to my arms and legs being utterly rubbish at fitting into things."
What's your favorite hobby?,Makeup/ cosmo stuff
Have you ever turned down a promotion/passed on an offer/left a job even though it meant giving up a lot of money? Why? Would you do it again?,"Yes, my first job out of college I quit and took a lower paying job for a couple of years. I'd do it again because I'm the type of person who will leave if I'm not enjoying the work and environment that I'm in. I would REALLY have to hate working at the place in order to follow through and interview around."
"If every man had to be a woman for one day, what would you have them do?",I’d want them to just have a fun day exploring themselves and the different things they don’t get to do as a male.
Women who have gone through addiction how did you overcome it?,"I don’t know if you overcome addiction as much as you maintain health and sobriety. The fight is there, but some days are easier than others."
Women who have gone through addiction how did you overcome it?,"You don’t ever “beat it” so to speak. Temptation is always there. 

You have to commit to making your health, your boundaries and overall well-being (however you define that) a very high priority. Seems to do the trick."
What's your favorite hobby?,Singing
What are some things you would like to see in an Airbnb?,"Ice cold AC, white noise machine, super soft pillows and sheets. Clean bathroom with toiletries. On a weird side note, I am super sensitive to the sounds of birds chirping in the morning. I have an extreme aversion to it. Very different from most, and I am completely aware of it, but I would rather hear traffic horns or just about anything else than birds chirping. It has gotten so bad I wear noise cancelling earphones."
Do you need to see models that look like you in order to want to purchase something online?,"Not look like me, but thinner/fit. I find I don't want to buy anything that's on fat models. Makes the clothes look very unflattering to me."
"If every man had to be a woman for one day, what would you have them do?","Have the heaviest day of a period with the worst cramps, get hit on 10 different times, receive a couple dick pics, and truly feel and see through our inner demons (sadness, dysmorphias, fears, embarrassments) so they can get a very REAL experience and understanding."
"Compared to past generations, what are your thoughts about the millennial male?","I mean, better than the boomer male, but still leaves much to be desired."
How can a man distinguish between “being friendly” from “I’m really interested”?,"Simply, you can't. Every woman's going to behave differently. Flirty behaviour for some is just friendly for others. Some are so subtle even friendly is hard to separate from everyday let alone flirting."
"Compared to past generations, what are your thoughts about the millennial male?","Most are improving, but some  are still stuck in the stone ages."
Do you need to see models that look like you in order to want to purchase something online?,No but I only buy things online which I already have a sense of how they'll fit me (e.g. I own other clothes from that brand).
"Compared to past generations, what are your thoughts about the millennial male?","Just as many assholes, but more porn-addled."
"Compared to past generations, what are your thoughts about the millennial male?",I don't see much improvement. Patriarchy is just as strong as ever.
"If every man had to be a woman for one day, what would you have them do?","Get an eyelash stuck inside your eye, then try to take it out while wearing eyeliner, primer and shadow, freshly manicured acrylic nails, pump high heels and cheap $1.00 super itchy eBay nylons😈

If you ruin your makeup you lose🙅🏻‍♀️"
What are some things you would like to see in an Airbnb?,"Self check in mechanism (a lockbox or code or whatever) because sometimes I'm checking in at weird times and I don't want to bother my host.

Local restaurant and pub recommendations, including how far away they are, opening times and maybe a menu.

A TV with streaming abilities is appreciated. Either built in or has a Chromecast or whatever.

If the shower isn't obvious to use, some instructions please! So many showers are maddeningly confusing.

I've always appreciated hosts who include some food, whenever it's snacks or a light breakfast. I recently went on holiday and liked the hosts who left fruit, snacks and yoghurts."
Have you ever turned down a promotion/passed on an offer/left a job even though it meant giving up a lot of money? Why? Would you do it again?,"When I was teaching I gave in my notice early (as you have to do it a term in advance) before I had anything lined up because I knew I was moving city. Before I finished teaching, I found a job in the new city though it was a pay cut, but the lower cost of living in the new city made it not so bad. But I took it despite some clear red flags because I didn't know the new city and I wasn't going to risk unemployment.

I've also recently turned down a job offer. It would have been much more money, but it would have quadrupled my commute and once the train travel was taken into account, it would only have been like a 3k payrise which didn't seem worth it. It was also a slight step down in responsibilities."
What is a women's clothing trend you never want to see again?,I never again want to see women forced to fit into a certain type of style/fashion box in order to be deemed attractive or societally acceptable.
"Compared to past generations, what are your thoughts about the millennial male?","Millennials are like, 30 now. I'm not that impressed by the majority of 30-something men I meet."
What are some things you would like to see in an Airbnb?,A friendly house pet
Have you ever turned down a promotion/passed on an offer/left a job even though it meant giving up a lot of money? Why? Would you do it again?,It was a choice between making a large amount of money working late night hours and constantly afraid of being berated and micromanaged by the boss or making a little bit lesser money but not so late hours and vacation flexibility. Freedom is priceless.
What are some things you would like to see in an Airbnb?,cats
What is a women's clothing trend you never want to see again?,The spandex pencil skirts that every single girl wore to middle school dances in the early 2010s
Women who have gone through addiction how did you overcome it?,I stopped smoking because of my income
Do you need to see models that look like you in order to want to purchase something online?,"Yes. I’ve been lucky to have a model body type so it’s always been easy to tell what clothes will look like on me based on the model. I’m little shorter than online models (5’7) but it’s close enough. The only big difference is that I have brown skin so sometimes I have to imagine how certain colors will look on me.

The first time I saw an online store model that don’t have my body type was on fashion nova. A good chunk of their models have big hips and I remember my thought process when looking at the models was “ugh why can’t I see these clothes on girls with *my* body type.” And then I realized how hard it must be for other women on a regular basis"
What is a women's clothing trend you never want to see again?,Low rider jeans.
Do you need to see models that look like you in order to want to purchase something online?,"I dont NEED to, but it does help to have some kind of idea what it might look like. If it goes up to my size and theres only a photo of a skinny girl with small breasts, I'll have to really love it to put it in my cart, as opposed to making a mental note to try it on next time I'm in whichever store it's from."
What is a women's clothing trend you never want to see again?,Spaghetti strap tank tops fuck that
What is a women's clothing trend you never want to see again?,"Leggings, crop tops

I'm not holding my breath, though."
Women who have gone through addiction how did you overcome it?,"I don’t think you ever overcome it. For me, it’s just avoidance of the activity and avoidance of people you associate with/still carry out that activity. You have to change your circumstances, life style and routine. It’s constantly fighting the demons and keeping a sense of sensibility. 

Also, maybe talk to people who have gone through the same thing. Find something else to focus on. Get a hobby. Distract yourself. Keep mentally strong."
How can a man distinguish between “being friendly” from “I’m really interested”?,"Flirting, smiling, eye contact, running into you a lot. nervousness,  an invitation to do something, more attention than other people get.  If you can't tell and you are interested, sometimes you just have to take a shot and don't get to bumped if it doesn't work."
"Compared to past generations, what are your thoughts about the millennial male?","eh, not impressed. but even my grandma always said that men ain’t shit, so that’s probably nothing new."
What's your favorite hobby?,"Crochet and no, I'm not a granny."
How can a man distinguish between “being friendly” from “I’m really interested”?,"Honestly, just ask. Guessing from nonverbal cues is never a clear indicator."
What are some things you would like to see in an Airbnb?,To not be a contributor to housing problems in an area.
When did you realise that that person was actually a stalker/stalking you? When did something that used to seem sweet or thoughtful become creepy?,"I had to find out from a mutual that this person had told their family we were dating and that they were so in love with me and happy we were together. I had only talked to them once. I left town and came back to other mutuals saying I broke his heart and ruined his life. He would text me asking me where I was &amp; I'd say out (cause I didn't want to see him or talk with him after all that) and he would say ""but your bedroom light is on?"""
What's your favorite hobby?,"I read a lot. If you don't know what kind of books you'd enjoy, join a library and browse the ""just returned"" shelf. It's a random mix of what other people read from all departments. If anything sounds interesting, give it a chance and read the first pages.

If you live far away from a library, or don't feel like seeing people, the whole thing also works online with ebooks from libraries."
How do you destress after a stressful day?,"Boxing when I’m crunched for time, shooting range if I have a while."
When did you realise that that person was actually a stalker/stalking you? When did something that used to seem sweet or thoughtful become creepy?,"Recently there was this guy from another country that would send me DMs on Instagram. They weren't sexual. They were a little too much but the level was ""easily could be because English is a foreign language to him."" I ignored them all. Twice he left a comment that was flirty and it was extra annoying I have a low-key profile with little traffic on IG. Like you would totally expect him to read social cues it would be inappropriate to leave a comment AND that I was clearly ignoring him.

Well on my birthday under a post about my birthday, he first wished me a happy birthday with pet names. And then apparently sent a DM to my cousin after he saw her comment under my pic, asking me if she was my friend. I blocked him then."
How do you destress after a stressful day?,I like to shower or do a face mask
What is a women's clothing trend you never want to see again?,Any *circulatory system hater* clothing piece.
What's your favorite hobby?,"Journaling!

Most do it as bullet journal? But mine is a mix of everything. It's my diary, travel journal and everything. I would write down what I want to do, my feelings or thoughts, advices or life hacks or movies I should watch. And I would paste pictures and decorate it. It is one of the few ways I can destress"
What is a women's clothing trend you never want to see again?,Whale tails.
