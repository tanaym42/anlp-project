Which means not only that the lame stuff gets pushed to the bottom where you can ignore it, but that, because the order can change, users won't be tempted into the kind of it-is-so, it-is-not, it-is-so kind of interchange that makes Slashdot comments so tedious.

And of course there's no ""frist post!"" phenomenon, because the (graphically) first post is the one voted the best, not the first chronologically.

Plus you can take a real karma hit if you post something dumb that a lot of people mod down.  That should make people think twice.

Every day hundreds of Chinese line up in Beijing to file past his waxy, slightly bloated corpse (I know, I was one of themâ¦and itâs hard to preserve a corpse) and pay their respects.  Despite killing millions of his fellow Chinese with his programs, he is still regarded by many with a great deal of admiration.  The Cult of Mao is quite penetrating.  Weighing in with the âofficial Party stanceâ on Mao, Deng Xiaoping called him âseven parts right and three parts wrong.â

Kinda makes you wonder what it would take for someone to be âten parts wrong.â

Also, it should also be noted that Mao insisted on subordinates who acquiesced to his every request, regularly falsifying production quantities, orchestrating false demonstrations of âmodelâ work communes, etc. all elaborately manufactured to appease Mao.  Over the years, he became so ignorant to the realities of Chinaâs plight that much of the destruction he caused was not intentional, but rather a by-product of his own insularity.  Not that this excuses it, but it may broaden the perspective from which we view it.

This is not really the designer's fault, since the course is aimed at all scientists generally.  However, the scientists I tend to work with mostly have a biology background and (contrary to the course designer's claims about scientists in general) they do *not* take to the rigour of programming easily.  Just about the only way I've found of keeping their attention is by making the examples 100% focused and relevant to their field of expertise.

0,"What your missing is that comparative advantage can only be realized with free trade. Free trade is a theory.

In this theory if goods had unfettered access between country A and B, both countries would specialize in what they are good at.

The U.S. with its high standard of living and education is more apt at making technology and culture driven products. For people in the U.S. to be farming does not make much sense, becuase they have access to better education and have more capital.
People in Africa have nothing, they could use nature to farm, and thats about all they can do.

So it would make sense for the Africans to do the farming and the US to build the websites to sell the farm produce.

But the Africans can not farm, because if they grew the produce they could not sell it to anyone, because the American stuff is already cheaper.

Of course, in the real world things are not that simple, not everyone in the U.S. is rich or has access to good education, and not everyone in Africa is destitute (but most are) I painted a pretty simple picture with that theory.

Furthermore the situation in Africa is worse then this. There is no infrastructure because all the governments are so corrupt. Bill Gates could throw all the money in the world at the diseases, but nobody over there is really getting innoculated. Most of the scientists getting special education are leaving africa. It really is a bad situation, one that people should put more effort into being aware of.

Except for one side argument.

It seems to me the article claims that for an economy to be successful it must let their wealth generators keep what they make.  That without this component the talented will have no incentive to create.

That may be the reason capitalism has been so successful, but are we sure our economy isn't just a local maximum?

Is there really no other reason to create wealth?

You argue that without this incentive everyone's output will be reduced to the mean as it is in a big bureaucratic business.

But you also state that no-one really like working this slow and that an engineer would work their ass off on sexy projects like fighter jets.  Open source is another example that shows there has to be more incentives to a person than just building wealth.

Maybe big business can't get as much out of their troops because the only incentive they can give is money.  What if they no longer needed to provide this.  What if they were forced to find something else to give their employees.  Would they be able to motivate people better than they do now?

Google has many top producers that no longer need personal wealth and yet they still seem to be innovating.


Maybe capitalism works so well because it's easy.  Letting people keep what they create takes relatively little infrastructure.

But, as the economy grows it seems to be getting harder.  We need more laws, more financial institutions, more cruft.  More wasted wealth.


Building the infrastructure of a central economy without corruption is a hard, risky problem.  But maybe at some point it will be cheaper than what we have now.",t5_6,t3_20775,False,reddit.com,2

But they also published everyone's contribution to profits, from the firm all the way down to the individual. Not only did they get self-motivated workers and amazing results, but middle management withered away to nothing.

a single officially recognized, state funded, church denomination that was considered the ""default religion"" for anybody who didn't choose to opt out of it and pick another - would have to cater to everyone, could not afford to discriminate or act too fundamentalist crazy. it would have to be a church for the whole people, and therefore couldn't make enemies of anybody, really.

and because it'd be the largest religion by far, it -- with its necessary tolerance -- would become the standard for other denominations to be judged by. an association with the state would tame religion, i think.

or, since this _is_ the USA we're talking about, maybe it would destroy the state. politics here have a way of being bass-ackwards a lot of the time.",t5_6,t3_21249,False,reddit.com,-5

You should know how to ""implement"" quickly in your field. For programming, that means actually writing code. For writing, that means getting words down on a page. In science, it must be conducting an experiment, no matter how shoddy.

Programmers and artists are blessed because they have easy ways to sketch. All fields have ways to sketch, though: someone looking to fix the U.S. healthcare system could create a simulation, or see how there plans would impact five different people that they know.

0,"my experience is probably atypical, but I think 2 startups came out of the class I was in-one dotcom, and a biometrics integrator.  
It would be interesting to have an entrepreneurship class that was graded solely on the basis of a final project, and which had a required application for admission.  Other than the fact that the students would still have other classes to do and that they would be drawn from a single university, it sounds similar to SFP.  (modulo (diff Y-comb teacher)) 
This would seem to be a step along the vector from normal angel investors to Y-combinator: you lower the cost of entry for the would-be entrepreneurs and give up some control.
As you lower barriers to entry into anything, you will tend to get a worse average but a better leadergroup.  Actually, that is not quite true-when you lower &lt;i&gt;uniform&lt;/i&gt; barriers to entry, that is the case.  When nonuniform barriers to entry are lowered, the average might go up too.      The university need not give the kids enough to live on-they already have dorms, etc..  Further, the universities need not get ANY of the company to make it worth their effort-they could take 1% of the company and give it to the instructors or something as part of the terms of the class, and thus guarantee that this class had the pick of the instructors, but they have no additional cost and hence no need to profit.
If the class was given over the summer semester, then it would get REALLY cheap for the colleges-they have excess housing for the summer anyway.
So other than their cluelessness, why don't the very best colleges do their own in-house Y-combs?  I bet Olin Shivers would do such a class, as would Robert Dewar at NYU, and Greenspun at MIT.",t5_6,t3_20775,False,reddit.com,4

As for rails, I think there are a few tools out there. I guess the trick is to automate it. Automate, automate, and then automate again. Ideally you will just run one command to deploy, one to undo that deployment if it all goes wrong.

Prescod makes several unsubstantiated claims, in particular that an object is a ""better"" abstraction than a function, and that programmers do not like deeply nested expressions. The former statement strikes me as meaningless: some will program just as well with functions as others will with objects. The latter observation hints at the strange element of Lisp syntax that differentiates it from other programming languages: deeply-nested expressions.

&gt; Most other languages don't have as many parentheses. Most other languages do not use prefix syntax. Glancing over a sheet of Lisp code and a sheet of Python code, what will strike you most is the difference in indentation. The Python code will have several more sections of statements at the same indentation level.

Prescod claims that most programmers prefer this type of indentation. Of course, he has no data to back up this claim.

0,"Paul covers a lot of ground in this essay.  A good deal of economics and development theory and history.  A great many minds have spent a lot of time on these topics and I think overall they haven't found the answers to be as simple as Paul makes them out to be.  I am not one of these scholars so I won't make the definitive critique but I can think of a few points:

Families need stability as well as economic growth.  Paul's formula provides no way to even try to find the right balance.

A tremendous amount of wealth is created by government funded research.  Think of all the medical research and the military funding of ARPA and missile programs (and transistors).  Paul's analysis has no good way to account for that.

There is a tremendous amount of wealth being create by the free/open source movement that cannot be accounted for by Paul's analysis.  The FOSS seems to be populated by socialist utopians from a bygone era.  Richard Stallman is a leftist of some kind and Linus Torvalds is from Finland, a &lt;i&gt;relatively&lt;/i&gt; socialistic country.

It is not really possible to prove why the industrial revolution happened where it did.  You can make reasoned arguments, but that's not the same thing.

We need to explain why ancient Greek was able to create so much mathematics without any entrepreneurs.

In the age of nuclear weapons and genetic engineering we still need to be able to rein in some kinds of research. No entrepreneur will do that.  Unless one invents something...

Change introduces instability and the danger of this is neither predictable nor controllable.  There is undeniable risk.

It isn't that so much of what Paul said was wrong is that there is so much else that needs to be explained and that none of it can be proven.

It must also be said that if it were not for the entrepreneurs not only would I not have a career but I would probably not be alive.  I'm not denying the positive side -- I'm saying the analysis Paul gives is just not enough.  It's version 0.1, not version 5.1.

0,"&gt; Very interesting. I might be wrong, however, but it seems that many of his assertions about ""Judeo-Christian"" seem to be only the ideas of Christianity, not Judaism at all.

As far as I can tell, he only makes two assertions about Judeo-Christian ideas, and both stem from Judaism and thus had a foundation in Christianity.

&gt; Cain kills Abel, and we inherit the âmark of Cainâ, and the myth of Cain â the belief that we are all somehow murderers at bottom.

This shows a misunderstanding of the core concepts behind that story. First of all, the only person to inherit the mark of Cain was Cain himself, and second of all, the Biblical story isn't that we are all murderers at the bottom, but rather sinners - whether that sin be greed, lust, idolatry, murder, etc.

&gt; Until the twentieth century, Judeo-Christianity tended to focus on the first one; the Serpent's apple, popularly if not theologically equated with the discovery of sexuality. But as sexual taboos have lost their old forbidding force, the âmark of Cainâ has become relatively more important in the Judeo-Christian idea of âoriginal sinâ. The same churches and synagogues that blessed âjust warsâ in former centuries have become strongholds of ideological pacifism.

I think the only reason this is the case is not because theologically anything has changed, but rather politically the Catholic church isn't as powerful any longer and waging wars isn't in its best interest (I for the record am not a Catholic).

And its interesting that the author says what he does, because until the 20th century, the fruit (it wasn't the Serpent's nor was it an apple), didn't really have to do with sexuality, but rather with a loss of innocence. The man and woman now were wise, and instead of simply wanting to obey God, they started worrying about the fact that they were naked, etc. The whole ""sexuality"" bit about the fruit has been a romantization of it over the past century.

The article itself seems pretty valid, it probably would've helped his case to keep inaccurate statements about Christianity out of it, though.",t5_6,t3_21369,False,reddit.com,-3

But none of this takes away from the very plain, very obvious fact that GOOD AND BAD PROCRASTINATION is extremely well-written.  And if PG has the insight to choose his friends to proofread his essays (as do I for mine because they all happen to be smarter than I am!!), then all the better.

0,"I'd like to make 3 points about Paul's essay:

1) Just because someone is able to focus on some ""great project"", I don't see that, in itself, as having merit. It depends on what the outcome of the project is. Adolf Hitler was deloused at the expense of the state in 1908 and was effectively destitute at that time. However, he rose to great power following WWI. There wasn't a lot of procrastination as he strove towards his big project's goal. In short, there's a moral aspect to what we work on.

2) ""Are you working on the most important problems in your field?"". Having spent many years in scientific research myself, I have to ask the question: ""who decides what the important problems are?"". Thomas Gold was right on the money for some problems that weren't even on the radar screens of his peers! Of course, he also had some spectacular misses; but my point is that few institutions tolerate men like Thomas Gold.

3) Many artists (and I include mathematicians, scientists and business people here too), successful or otherwise, are so self absorbed with themselves I find them both boring and fairly shitty people to work with, or just to be around them. Personally see some merit in, say, someone who puts the needs of his or her children first - in effect, making them ""Project 1"". Nor do I see it as inevitable that if you do so, that you cannot also be successful in other areas of your life.

That said, I very much enjoyed Paul's essay as it put some of the main issues of procrastination into stark contast.

I just wanted to say that I agree with this. However, you have to exercise care when designing macros that are used together with existing language constructs. Hidden parameters and the like break the user's expectation of Scheme's scoping mechanism, and should only be done if the alternative is way too inconvenient. If you are designing embedded DSLs using macros, the rules are totally different, of course.

Also, even if you take the macro route, it is considered good style to factor out as much as possible into functions to keep the macro definition minimal.

In your article you also mention that it's kind of inconvenient to have to specify 'yield' as a parameter to define-generator. If you are going for the baked-in feel, you can get around this by using non-hygienic macros, e.g. syntax-case macros (which most good Scheme systems support).",t5_6,t3_21426,False,reddit.com,1
0,"What I find interesting about Graham's essays is that he so often approaches what are conventionally considered ""business"" or ""humanistic"" problems and approaches them from the point of view of a programmer who has a fair amount of business and life experience. The insights are almost always worth my reading. (I'm a folklorist who has begun to think and write about similar topics starting from the humanistic perspective -- the dearth of interesting work by humanists on technology is just surprising. I'm a little, okay a lot, embarrassed for the academy.)

I come to reddit from reading Graham's essays -- and thanks to Slashdot for first turning me onto Graham! And I'm glad I clicked on the ""comment"" link, because I think a lot of people have raised important qualifications to Graham's schema. Most of these qualifications point out that all those B-level operations still must get done. The fallouts are: 

* Individuals who do only C and never B tasks in fact defer those tasks to others. This is possible in a work environment where there is a staff to handle those B tasks -- which is an interesting conundrum given Graham's argument that staff hired to handle B tasks often in fact interrupt those who work on the C tasks and hired them in the first place in order to defer the B tasks. In a home environment, B task deferment falls to a partner, whom you can only hope doesn't have C tasks of their own -- I know a lot of successful academics, mostly men, who have very (*very*) patient (and forgiving and a lot of other things) wives that tend to all the B tasks.

* Individuals who only focus on C tasks, while perhaps achieving some level of greatness (and/or recognition), are often individuals who are out of balance. They are, to put it less politely than some of the commentators here have, assholes. (Again, my experience in the academy gives me plenty of examples to call upon.) So, while we may admire their achievements, it's often the case (not always) that we also recognize that they are miserable human beings, and plenty of people choose a ""more mediocre"" life but one of relative happiness (however you want to define the latter term).

* Sometimes A and B tasks are integral to getting C tasks done. As several posters put it, sometimes doing something else is a way of working on the C task you were ""supposed"" to be working on all along. Both the poet Wallace Stevens and the linguist Edward Sapir -- one an accountant and the other an insurance underwriter by occupation -- are reported to have gotten their best work done during long walks. So, C taskers who were occupied by B tasks who got their C tasks done while doing A tasks.

Economically the difference from old businesses is that your front desk cost now is easily available for anyone, and its cost is pretty much constant as the users grow. Your front desk is your site.

Web 2.0 is about using the network effects in your site. The more your site is used, the more beneficial it is for its users. Your site is not just a connection between you and your users, it is many-to-many connection between your users. 

It is a lot like bringing network effects like the ones we know from instant messaging on a new platform - the Web. Why is the Web suitable for this? Because there are already acccumulated solid and general mechanisms that make the web work, and you can plug in yours more easily. If you use things like RSS, REST, JSON, etc it is also easier for others to plug in to you. This is how mashups come into play.

This is a lot like a preexposed and generalized democracy component. Being nice to users is necessary in the context of democracy, because in such environment minor usability enhancements have compound effect to the bottom line: that's why Ajax is necessary. Now that extra effort to make the site a little more useful is actually worth it. You need to enable users to be effective in your democracy, because this affects the bottom line. You need to be easily reachable, which accounts for APIs, bookmarklets, backlink tracking etc.

But I think democracy is a misnomer: political democracy is about voting, and have the majority win. Minority doesn't get what it wants. It is quite a different mechanism that works with The Long Tail: everyone should get what is suitable for him. Most Web 2.0 applications are not quite there, but clearly this is the trend.

P.S: It is an interesting thought experiment to imagine implementing a Long Tail kind of democracy politically. Neal Stephenson envisions a world of small districts with radically different laws in ""Snow Crash"". But it is not necessary to divide the laws by land (so that you must obey different laws depending on your location). You may have rights, obligations and access to public services depending on a set of laws you choose to be yours (e.g. an important citeria would be the taxes you have to pay).

Thomas Gold probably thought what he was working on was one of the most important problems in his field, even if his peers didn't.

anyway.  I'd just like to add that I've been reading Paul's essays for years now, and they've almost all been uniformly great. I can't even remember where I first encountered him.  I sent him an e-mail a few months ago, and he answered it, even though I'm sure he gets hundreds of e-mails per day.  I've been trying to think up a second e-mail topic that might be interesting enough to garner another reply, but I haven't yet.

Those of you talking about exceptions to his putting-off-errands message are, perhaps, missing relevant experience to understand what he's talking about.  Someone said he had to put off A tasks such as interviewing programmers, for example, to do B-level errands.  I'm pretty sure that's not what Paul is talking about.

There are some types of work that are almost infinitely hard.  You can only work on such problems in long, uninterrupted stretches of time, and only when properly inspired.  Certain types of computer programming are that hard for me.  If I found myself in a mood to tackle one of those hard problems, then yeah, I would absolutely put off laundry, changing the oil in my car, paying the bills, or anything else to put the work behind me.  If your field doesn't require that sort of work from you, I guess I envy you a little bit, because it's really draining.  If so, you are perhaps not someone that Paul's essay applies to.

Speaking as a sometime development editor with a major publishing house, I'm all in favor of a more stringent editorial process managed by people who are able to say ""no"" to self-indulgent and cocky authors. I've seldom had an adversarial relationship with an author, but I've had a few run-ins that taught me the value of someone with real distance from the work and some control over cutting the checks having a hand in the process.

But instead, the author deliberately escalated the situation.

Maybe its just me, but I haven't been to an electronics store lately that did not check your receipt on the way out ... unless it was a mom and pop operation in a good part of town.

These kinds of situations can easily get out of hand if it kept escalating ... leading to damage, injured persons, or worse if somebody involved had a gun. The Best Buy guy followed the author out to his car - big mistake. Both sides in the dispute were escalating ... a recipe for disaster.

0,"Meh; whether you're being ""an ass"" or not, the law's on the consumer's side (oddly enough). If you pay for membership at a store, like at a Sam's Club or a Costco, they can make ""must stop at door for receipt inspection"" a condition of membership. That's about it.

A store anyone can shop at can't stop you at the door to check your receipt. They can ask you to stop, but they can't actually physically stop you.

I agree completely with the author's position -- if I pay for something, I'm done. I have no need for security cronies following me demanding I prove I've paid for it. ""Guilty until innocent"" doesn't fly with me. Prove I stole something from you.

Had I been in a similar position, the moment brute force (or the threat of such) was used to physically stop me from leaving, I'd have offered a single warning to move away from me and clear my vehicle's path (inviting them to record my license plate but warning that a car weighs a *lot* more than a human). Then, if they'd refused, I'd have called the police myself, and pushed as hard as I could to have charges filed against everyone involved.

If this really happened the way the author describes, the security minions at the store had already made so many mistakes in their handling of the situation that even if he *had* stolen the stuff, they'd have had major trouble getting charges to stick. It's fine to follow the guy out to his car to ask him to return to the store. Everything that happened afterwards *isn't*. Using your body to prevent a person from entering their car to leave is a form of detainment (unlawful at that). Using your body to block the vehicle's departure is similarly detainment.

The author really should have involved the police as soon as he saw the situation escalating. I, too, have shopped at stores that want to inspect my receipt at the exit. I've thanked them for their interest and walked past them without ""presenting my papers"" every single time. We do not (yet) live in a society where we're guilty until we prove we're not, and I refuse to submit to little power trips like that.

Incidentally, you can still return something to a store that ""marks"" receipts they inspect at the door even without the little ""inspection mark.""

This probably sounds nasty, but here's the bottom line: shoplifting and theft at stores like this is *not* my problem. I am not part of the problem, and I am not going to be a willing participant in your solution. If your inventory system is so broken that you really *do* have to count stuff sold as it goes out the door, upgrade your inventory system. If you have a rampant shoplifting problem, take effective steps to make identification and prosecution of thieves easier. You discourage theft by making it unprofitable and personally destructive to the thieves, not by inconveniencing and annoying your customers.

Hassling people at the door is almost *never* successful and usually at least annoys people (and in this case, it was much worse), and when you try it with someone who actually knows their rights, you get incidents like this. While those goons were chasing after a paying customer, countless others walked out the front doors without a glance from the ""security"" guy who's supposed to be pouncing people at the door for their receipts. You can't show whether that let another thief out the door, but the customer the goons chased down turned right back around, and whipped out that receipt not for ""proof of purchase"" but for ""I want a refund, *now*"" purposes.

The store lost a sale because of its behavior *after* it'd made the sale and the customer was *out the door*. That's pretty sad.",t5_6,t3_21841,False,reddit.com,10

You might be right, and you're living by your principles,  but you could be dead too. I think staying alive is the wisest option, unless you're really willing to take responsibility for the consequences of your actions.

OK, so maybe thats a little bit dramatic and over the top, but you have to ask yourself ""is this really worth getting into an argument over? am I willing to pay the consequeces? How far will I go if they step it up a notch ?""

In many situations, the wrong answer to that question will result in even bigger problems, even if you're ""right"".

""So far, Java seems like a stinker to me. I've never written a Java program, never more than glanced over reference books about it, but I have a hunch that it won't be a very successful language.""

How can you make a claim that Java isn't a successful language? You're going to back ""Java's cover"" by citing an article written in BusinessWeek? (Clearly BW is an authority on programming languages.) Did you even read the article -- the author clearly isn't a hacker (certainly not by your standards). If you read the comments at the end of the article, you'll see that someone rightfully called him on his distorted view of computer technology:

""Given my reading of this article, I have my doubts that the author even understands the difference between an OS, a server, and a language. It's mostly nonsense to an actual programmer. Why does he repeatedly position open source software as an alternative to Java?""

As an example of how inane the BW article is:

""The situation at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. (MER) in New York is telling. The investment bank runs many of its newer math-heavy applications -- such as options, futures, and derivatives -- using just Linux and the Apache server.""

Wow, they do all of that with just Linux and Apache? Apache 1.3 doesn't calculate derivatives for me -- I guess I need to upgrade to 2.2. Doesn't Merrill have to write any code to do all that math? This question probably didn't occur to the author because he *doesn't know any better.*

If you want to continue to defend ""Java's cover,"" then that's fine (there are some worthwhile points in there), but at least do so with some decent evidence. Speaking of which, did you notice these facts in the article:

""In North America, the percentage of developers who use Java as one of their principal programming languages declined to 47.9 in Evans' fall survey.""

""IBM stands by its commitment to Java. Its WebSphere middleware is a multibillion-dollar business that grew 14% last quarter.""

But just some notes for discussion:

2) I think that hanging around people who are openly gay makes people more likely to act gay. People tend to act like their peers. I understand there is a strong political motivation against statements like that, but sexuality is such a social and physiologically complex thing --more complex than a simple yes/no physical trait. It seems somehow demeaning, and at best, dishonest, to claim otherwise. I think we can all reasonably agree that social behavior is influenced by our social interactions. That sounds obvious to me.

Simply, acceptable behavior is more expressed. Plus, sexuality doesn't seem to be a clean straight/gay division, so I think that a more homosexual-friendly society would give borderline people more options. That is, instead of only being willing to have straight relationships, they would be free to have homosexual ones, too. How is that unreasonable?

3) Marrying a dog or a child or a car is absurd. But this still opens some interesting ""why not"" questions (for me at least, I'm a comp sci guy, not a law guy). If marriage is whatever consenting adults agree to, why not polygamy? Why not an 80 year old and a 20 year old (legal but frowned on). Why not a ""year free trial"" clause? Or a marriage subscription that must be renewed every 90 days? Why not? Interesting stuff...
",t5_6,t3_22035,False,reddit.com,6
0,"Very nice essay.

One point of further consideration is that the advice in the essay probably does not apply to children.  Children are generally right to explore many things, and not worry too much about whether they are solving the hardest problems that exist, or not.  Any problem that helps them learn, even one other people have already solved, will do.  So the child playing video games instead of working on solving public good problems in economics, or even just learning calculus, probably isn't doing anything wrong.

One parallel is that adults, too, shouldn't worry overly about solving the hardest problems that exist, as long as they are learning and making progress.  Working on the hardest problems a person can is all we can ever ask of him.

I think it's worth considering what other parallels there are and how to unify the theories of how children and adults should look at hard problems and procrastination.

What Russell is saying this:  If there exists a moral obligation to do work, it is to fill the needs of ourselves and others.  However, since the advent of industrialism, the needs (and desires) of society are far less than the amount of value that we create by doing work.  Thus, there is no feasible moral obligation to work as hard as is socially accepted.

Furthermore, Russell argues, overworking ourselves at unpleasant tasks causes unuseful misery.  So, if we all worked less at our ""jobs"", we'd be happier and have more time and energy for enjoying ourselves.

0,"That is commonly believed but not accurate.  C is a fairly bad assembler, as can be testified by anyone who has compiled basicly any functional language to C.  It is fairly hard to support multiple-value-return, continuations are a bit of a bear, and fast function call interfaces such as those used by Ocaml are not possible (at least, not portably).  For something to be an assembler, you would want to be able to get at the stack, which you cannot do (directly) in C.  Java is even worse as an assembler, and it gets used as an assembler sometimes.  I dearly hope that it does not become the de facto standard assembly the way C has.  It limits implementors in much the same way that semantically poor languages limit the programmer, and limiting the implementors hurts all of us.
As to low-level teaching languages, perhaps it would be useful to have a teaching architecture, like MMIX or the apple II or the amiga-all of them are probably understandable by a single person, and they are all a lot simpler than most current chips.

The book contains a whole section on procrastination [pp.114-117] and the passage I remembered is on page 117:

""Attempts to improve 'time management' fail because the procrastinator generally knows exactly when he should be doing what, but simply cannot bring himself to do it.""

It struck me that this passage and Graham's essay point to the underlying problem with most procrastination (in my mind at least) of being overwhelmed/having the thoughts vacuumed out of one's head by the problem and rarely is the problem not knowing what needs to be done. 

Personally, however, I find to-do lists helpful in both remembering which problems I currently have to work on. While I admit, often these include errands, they include the occasional 'big problem'/'big idea' and the attempted solution or implementation of the problem/idea inevitably gets worked out/outlined in a series of to-do lists. 

Perhaps my definition of to-do list is a bit off, though. (Really in some cases, it is more of an outline)

0,"Recursion is crippled in java because java does not do tail-call optimization.  If you wrote some java that did this: (pardon my lack of correct java syntax)
length(List l, int acc)
{  if (l.isEmpty == true)
       return acc;
   else
       return length(l.next, acc + 1);
}
you would eat an number of stack frames proportional to the length of the list.  If it is a circular list, you would run out of stack.  (does anyone know what java does in this case?)
In scheme, you would use a constant amount of stack, because  it is trivially provable that the return value of the function is just going to be passed up the stack anyway, so no new stack frames are allocated-the same one just gets recycled.  You can do this even if you have multiple functions calling one another.  Because recursion is so crippled in java relative to scheme, no one uses it in java, compared to the situation in scheme.  It's like lambda in python: it's there but so borked that it is rarely used.

I think this is not an implementation issue, but rather a spec issue (ie. java is specified NOT to do tail-call optimization).  Any language lawyers in the house know the answer on that?",t5_6,t3_22199,False,reddit.com,8

Date, and thereby hope I differentiate myself from most of todays CS Grads.""

If you program in Java, you had damn well better understand pointers. Or rather, you had better understand Java's references, which are safer than C-style pointers but which still have the same potential for problems with referential transparency and weird side-effect mazes. This is important in almost all languages; you can only truly escape it if you use a purely functional language like Haskell, and then only if you don't use the special syntax for imitating side-effects with state-transition monads.

""But I program in Java, and there are some ""weedout"" concepts, interfaces being the one that first springs to mind. I once heard interfaces called ""architecture enablers"" and maybe that is the difference between Java and the previous languages that were taught in CS courses.""

You think that interfaces are a difficult concept to grasp? They just reflect the common OO practice of making similar objects support the same methods for certain purposes. They're not even the best way of doing it; why doesn't Java allow you to specify that some variable must implement *multiple* interfaces? Haskell's type classes, which are very similar to interfaces, allow this, so it can't be too difficult to type-check, and the syntax wouldn't be too hard to understand.

""Not having to worry about pointers allows one to more quickly get to the point of being able to 'architect' a solution.""

Guess what? SICP, which uses Scheme as a teaching language, doesn't get to anything even vaguely pointer-like until chapter 3---and there are only 5 chapters. There are plenty of other languages which have less pointer crap to worry about than Java, and are easier to learn too, so students can get into the difficult concepts faster instead of dinking around with the syntax of a for loop.

Your ignorance is showing, and you don't seem to realize it. Please, learn Scheme and ML. It should be an eye-opening experience for you.

""Just be sure you hire Java programmers who grok interfaces, and for heavens sake stay away from PHP coders!""

Any Java programmer who doesn't even understand such a simple concept as interfaces shouldn't be hired, I agree. However, I fail to see the problem with PHP coders. If someone knows *only* PHP, of course they should probably be avoided, but PHP is a decent language for certain things.

Why? Because for many of the principles of software engineering: data hiding, code reuse (taking advantage of standard libraries, in particular), unit testing, it is most appropriate.

I know that there are those of you in the back of the classroom who snicker when you hear the phrase software engineering. You enjoy your functional language and have great disdain for Java. I bet that those of you who hold that viewpoint don't work on many software projects that are too large for you to have written yourself, or on large bodies of legacy code where half of the original authors of the codebase are now at another company, so you can no longer ask them what their code does.

When you start to find yourself in this situation, it's more helpful to do defensive programming than daredevil programming. A reference shouldn't be changed or a method shouldn't be overridden? Then declare it final in Java so the new guy who is working on the codebase can't override it. You can't do that in LISP because that's not LISP's philosophy: data and code are indistinguishable so nothing is really hidden if you cdr enough times.

Finally, there are many ways to think abstractly; certainly pointers and recursion aren't the only ones. A good interviewer should be able to discern a candidate's abilities without taking sides on his or her language preferences.

(Closures hide data, functions reuse code, and a repl allows you to test bits of code at a time.)  Is it just MORE of the above?  

As far as java being the best language for software engineering, that is an interesting statement.  I know of a bunch of very large systems written in C (too many to list), and some in C++(a lot of windows, for one), and some in various lisps (axiom, macsyma, genera, emacs), but the only 10^6 LOC thing I can think of in java is Eclipse, or maybe java itself.

0,"When I program in Lisp, a language noted for making widespread use of recursion, I normally do not write tail-recursive functions. (This is true to a lesser extent even in Haskell.) Most tail-recursive functions are instances of broader patterns which have already been identified and abstracted out, so I just use the abstractions.

The place where recursion really shines, even in languages which have all the common patterns abstracted out, is in manipulation of tree data structures. This sort of code usually doesn't lend itself easily to tail-call optimization, but it usually also doesn't create too many stack frames.

I'd say that the real reasons people don't use recursion as much in Java are these:

1. There's a widespread uneasiness about using recursion because it's commonly seen as very slow and prone to stack overflows. This doesn't have to be true, and in many languages it isn't, but in Java there is some cost to recursion. But this isn't a reason to avoid recursion in general, since the speed penalty is usually negligible.

2. Lots of people just don't get recursion. It is with considerable scorn that I note this, since recursion seems so easy.

3. Recursion is often taught as a scary thing. ""Beware, my students, and have your wits about you! For today, we're going to learn about a dark and scary thing called 'recursion'.

I didn't try to claim that Java is the _best_ language for software engineering; I'm arguing that it has properties that make large codebases easier to manage, hence a better vehicle for teaching software engineering.

Yes, functions reuse code, and every language has some idea of a function, subroutine, method, what have you, but I think that the standard library that comes with Java has much more to offer than what you get with other languages. You'll notice that it is quite consistent in terms of naming conventions and other things, which is impressive for a library of its size. This is code reuse on a larger scale than we see in other languages.

Another property that helps with managing large codebases is namespaces. Without namespaces, it is difficult to produce a large codebase and be certain that there won't be naming collisions if you need to make it work with another large codebase (suppose your software company acquires another one, for example -- again, this isn't a problem that you and your buddies face when hacking together -- I'm talking about something on a larger scale than that).

I concede that the REPL is a huge tool, which is why I use the DrJava plugin for Eclipse when I use Java. I hate the name, but it allows me to execute Java statements and try things out without creating a throwaway class with a main() method. ([shamelessPlug]If you're a JavaScript hacker, then you may want to check out my Chickenfoot extension for Firefox, which offers something of a REPL for JavaScript, plus a lot more[/shamelessPlug].)

The tools for refactoring in Java have become very good (as I said, I use Eclipse), which is also important when it comes to managing large codebases. In most languages, if you want to rename a variable in your code, then you run perl minus pie to rename it everywhere, cross your fingers, and hope that you didn't break anything. With tools like Eclipse, you can do that renaming such that you know that you haven't changed the behavior of your program. (Renaming a variable may be a weak example, extracting methods/interfaces are more compelling refactorings that Eclipse can do, but it's not as clear what the analogue is in some other languages, which is why I used the renaming example.)

This is not to say that such refactoring tools could not exist in other languages (in particular, functional programming languages), but I haven't seen them yet. Because Java is a bit of a control freak (to the dismay of ""Real Hackers""), creating such tools is easier to do for Java. There is certainly a fair bit of research going on to make analogous tools in other languages, but until they come to fruition, I think that teaching Java with Eclipse is a better way to teach software engineering.

I was a TA for 6.170 for three semesters at MIT, and I started the movement from Emacs to Eclipse. Since Eclipse made it so easy to run unit tests and interact with CVS, which I think are also important practices for a software developer, I thought it was clearly the way to go. As you can imagine, some students/faculty thought otherwise, but that's a whole different discussion.*

*For the record, no student (or faculty member :) was forced to use Eclipse in 6.170: students have always been free to use whatever tools they want. You can bet that we had, and will continue to have, die-hards who insist on using Emacs and checking in their code from the command line.

In terms of existing package/namespace systems, I can't speak to all of the languages you list, but right now, I'm looking at the Java 1.5 API (http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/index.html), and I'm trying to compare it to the equivalent Python API to see how its packages are organized, but I'm not sure whether the Python Library Reference (http://docs.python.org/lib/lib.html) is what I'm looking for (if this is the right site, then Python's packages sure appear more disorganized than Java's.) Classes in Java packages can also have data members that can be only accessed by other classes in the same package -- I'm not sure if the languages you list add that ability as part of their package system.

Finally, no, 6.170 students must code in Java for 6.170. Grading student code is difficult enough as it is -- I can't imagine what it would be like if we let students write in any language. Such variety would be a nightmare for our automated test suite and the other tools we use to help with grading (which are written in Python, incidentally).

I don't know what you mean by ""x,"" but I believe that the last language that was used for 6.170 was CLU, which is a language that was invented at MIT. It was one of the first (if not the first) languages to focus on data abstraction and I'm told it had nice iterators and exception handling, so I suppose this was a good choice for 6.170 back in the day. My best guess as to why they switched to Java (in the late 90s, I believe) is that it looked like Java was going somewhere and CLU wasn't (which certainly turned out to be true). Because of the switch, students have been able to make some fantastic final projects since they can leverage third-party libraries written in Java, such as OpenGL, which is a lot more fun than doing a project without such libraries. I also think it's important that there is at least one course in the CS curriculum that exposes students to tools that people use in the real world (CVS, Eclipse) as opposed to tools that were made for and by MIT (Edwin the Scheme editor).",t5_6,t3_22199,False,reddit.com,5
