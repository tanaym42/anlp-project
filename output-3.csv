"My interpretation of the article was more that the singleton pattern is used as a crutch by many programmers to be able to claim that they ""understand"" object oriented programming and design patterns. This is something I have seen many times myself when interviewing people, and also in a lot of code where the singleton pattern is, as the article describes, very often used in places where it is completely unnecessary.

It's not that the singleton pattern is stupid per se, but that it has become the most obvious symbol of how people misunderstand and misuse design patterns in general."

Chances are, when the timer goes off you'll have overcome the force field, engaged with the project, and be ready to keep working.

"The reason the music industry is loosing money is because they focus to much on disposable music. They find the front men (or women)to sing, get some music made by people who know only how to make music that is the sound of the ""moment"". Everyone knows their role, band member just do what their told to. Then this shit gets heavily marketed and people buy it, but buying audience is small and this stuff only gets brought while it is in fashion.
Compare that to music that gets to where it is through talent and passion. When I hear a marketed band singer singing about, say loss, It just can't reach me because it's not true and is sung without meaning. Compared that to a real band where it's the singers real experience. Music like this can continue to sell for decades and by all generations. If the music industry want there sales to go up they should go to the clubs and do talent spotting like they used to and not by people who think what will sell but who think what sounds good and more to the point what *feels* good."

"I thought this article was complete rubbish.  I didn't get the feeling the guy knows the first thing about programming, and he only provided extremely vague refutations of what Paul Graham had to say.  Nothing concrete, nothing specific.

The main point the author focuses on is the superficial differences between painting and programming (one of them is manipulating electronic bits and the other is putting oil on a canvas with a stick and animal hair).  From that he concludes the two things are totally and utterly different from each other.

Clearly this guy is not a real programmer, or probably even a good programmer for that matter.  I am sure that many, or even most programmers are not artists, but that isn't who Paul Graham writes about.  He writes about the great programmers, the ones who write code that reads like poetry, or unfolds like great art.  There are also plenty of programmers who can make you cry just by looking at their code, but that's a different kind of programmer entirely.

Personally I thought this article was stupid and filled with the kind of nonsence that he accused Paul Graham of perpetrating.  He complains that Paul Graham, Eric Raymond, and Dave Winer write about things they see in themselves and call that greatness.  Apparently this author writes about the shortcomings and failures he projects from himself onto other people.  Moron."

Moreover, you do see things in black and white, and just because you say you don't doesn't mean it's true. It's all talk, no walk. The only argument you have against prostitution is STDs, which obviously doesn't apply in this case. Thus you have NO logical argument against prostitution in this case, thus your objection stems from black-and-white, binary, low-level thinking, and thus, in conclusion, therefore, ergo, accordingly, _you are a wanker_.

Come on...you may have your theories, but this article tries to say, ""Jesus w as almost certainly a cannabis user and an early proponent of the medicinal properties of the drug, according to a study of scriptural texts published this month.""

If you actually studied the scriptural texts, I have no clue how you come up with these theories even if you look at it from a secular point of view. Again, I don't care how much your drench a dead body with cannabis, it sure as hell ain't coming back to life.

Either the stories are made up or they are real. An explanation like ""cannabis"" really doesn't cut it. As a matter of fact, the only reference of annointing oils in the New Testament was when a prostitute put them on Christ's feet. Many of the instances of healing in the NT were spontaneous and mention nothing about any oils.

For example, a woman who has a menstrual problem touches Christ and is healed. Christ turns around and asks who touched him because ""I felt power go out from me"". There is no mention that Christ turned around and put oils on the woman. She was the one who touched him.

I imagine this will get promoted purely due to how much people like to read controversial stuff, no matter how far it is from the truth. I wish the 'scholars' involved in this study did a better job of reading the texts."

He's saying that there are a substantial number of programmers who think they know good object oriented design practice just because they know what the singleton pattern is, even though they often don't understand when it should be used, and more importantly when it should NOT be used.

I completely agree that the singleton pattern is elegant and powerful when used well, but the cases where it is used well are rare in comparison to the number of people who use it blindly without really understanding the underlying concepts."

I got the impression that painting is nothing like hacking because one gets you laid and the other doesn't.  Now let's hear it from Paul Graham.  Are you just gonna sit there and take that?
"I get the feeling that a lot of people who diss JS have never seen the field from the side of hiring people, with tight budgets -- aka the real world. As an employer, you have significant challenges in getting the people you want, especially if you're a small company. Big companies can get whoever they want, by simple virtue of the Law of Big Numbers. When you can't afford to make a ""mistake"" upon hiring, you want to be able to find that ideal candidate. For a startup, which is where JS' experience derives, what you're working on is probably so far left-field that whatever ""practical"" experience your candidate has, they're going to need to learn a crap-load at your place before they're useful. For that particular situation, the thing you want above all else is the ability to learn, which a good working knowledge of things like pointers and CS theory is a good indicator of. Again, this is all predicated on small firm, doing something unusual."

"Drinking has a way of catching up to you, I suppose..."
"It is possible that the thrust of Paul Graham's argument was not that hackers are like painters in any literal sense, but that it is inaccurate to look at programmers as engineers(in the blueprints and slide-rule sense).

 Painting is merely a handy analogy. The fact that Graham is interested in painting(not entirely untalented as well), and knows something of its history (maybe not everything) certainly gives him enough authority to say 'hey, these things are not so different.' I have no problem believing that there is overlap between Paul Graham's painting-mode and Paul Graham's hacking-mode, and am glad for the insights he offers regarding the creative process in general.

It can be a bit annoying when people from the 'hard' sciences start talking about the Art of their practice. In my experience, this usually results from a confusion between beauty/elegance and Art at large. The last 150 years have served as a pretty strong argument that beauty != Art, and its no wonder that some people would find it difficult to consider merge-sort (or even viaweb) in the same light as Guernica.

However, by the same token, artists have a habit of intentionally mysticizing their work. Judging from the superficial beauty and elegance of the author's work I would say his process, all bohemian orgies aside, has a lot more in common with engineering than he would like to admit."

"We're programmers. Programmers are, in their hearts, architects -- Joel Spolsky

I think this is a much more matching analogy.
Being programming a creative activity of course
some analogy exists with painters too, but there is a deep difference
as architects have to be creative under a lot of constraints, from the
gravity force to space. This is also true for programmers, but I think it's
not the same for painters unless they choose to paint in a very specific way.

Sometimes it's said that the real creative moment of an architect is
not while he is designing something, but when he builds his own
""architectural system"". To design something is then the application
of such a system: still a creative activity, but not the most important
part. It seems like that it's true for programming too. You are
creative when you try to solve a given specific problem with the
tools you have, but your best effort is when you try to build
these tools in a generic way in your head, when you find new systems
to describe problems. As this appears to be (to me at least) not as
true as it is for programming and architecture if applied to painting, this
is somewhat a (not very objective maybe) proof that painting and
programming isn't the best match for an analogy."

I think the point was not Java vs Lisp or something like it.It was about how its difficult to test someone's CS concepts using java..For example a whole array of complex and tricky C style string manipulation stuff like strncmp and strcpy cant be asked to someone who thinks java.lang.Utils.String are only way to manipulate strings!

I think the internet will be very important in rectifying the annoying music situation. This is because the internet allows everyone to be involved, it removes barriers to finding new music.

I don't say that it will raise the quality of music, because I believe there is already a whole lot of high quality stuff out there, it just is not being exposed.

I think the trend is already starting, it will just gain momentum. As more people realize they can cheaply publish to the web, more will. This results in a huge amount of stuff being available. The great thing about the internet is that quality things always rise to the top through word of mouth."

And yet 99% of all students who get their degree here can't program worth a damn. Over half is a raving lunatic for their own language (usually C. Suggesting (insert any language here) is the only language you ever need to learn, and that all other languages, by virtue of not being (insert any language here) suck, is obviously a clear sign you don't get it)... and the rest run for cover the moment you dare speak the words 'programming!'.

try to find a better data structure, in order to pre-calculate whatever can be, and to minimize data structure traversals. try to memoize variables and expression values, to minimize re-running code and re-evaluating subexpressions. then think about algorithms, in case you can find a more efficient way of doing whatever you're still doing. only after that should you consider cache friendliness and memory locality."

"I've also compared programmmers to architects, in other essays.

There are some ways programmers are more like painters, though: for example, programs, like paintings, are all design, whereas buildings are designed by architects and then handed over to builders to build.  So you see a lot more rapid prototyping and refactoring in hacking and painting than architecture.  An architect has much less ability to change things once construction starts."

"That's exactly what the article addresses though. Most of the comments here are just re-iterating what JS says as if they hadn't read or understood this article which points out the logical fallacy that Joel has fallen into. It says that while Joel is accusing the Java 'kids' of being Blub programmers, Joel himself is a Blub programmer when looked at from a different perspective. It's a variation on the Paul Graham argument as it is saying that you can move the apex of the programming power scale dependent on the requirements and environment of the day. I like Joel's essays and I'm no Java fan but I do find his emphasis on stuff like pointers a bit strange for a company developing web apps. Surely a high-level approach with emphasis on architecture and RAD are more important - it's why we are seeing the rise of frameworks like Rails.

I think the problem with teaching them is the limited real-world examples that are usually demonstrated... I think event-driven programming versus the old console-style UI is a good showcase for coroutines, and continuations can be demonstrated building on coroutines in the context of web development.

"Well, sorry, but for me, CS courses are about making the programmer's life easy -- and *not* about making the life of the recruiter easy. 

If I can't tell a bright person from a not-so-bright one, that means I'm just crap at hiring. It does *not* mean universities are crap at teaching.

Moreover, in his essay, JS keeps complaining about crappy recruiters ""who use grep to evaluate rÃ©sumÃ©s"" and hire crappy programmers as a result. This one really bothers me, for two reasons:

1. If hiring crappy programmers is as simple as using grep, then why doesn't Joel just use grep *himself* to sort them out? 

2. Hiring brilliant programmers *must* be hard. Orelse everyone will be able to hire them and Joel will lose his competitive advantage.

I really think Joel is becoming a bit crotchety (as he himself admits).

I remember how back in the 90's everyone complained about how the universities treat CS as abstract *science* and do not teach you jack about actual *programming*, i.e. working for a real company in the real world.

Now, as universities start teaching people the stuff they'll most probably need to actually pay they bills, now that they start (or continue?) teaching programming languages that are actually used in the industry, now those *very same* people start telling us how much better the old days were.

C'mon, face it, the need for Scheme applications is not exactly rising.

Sure, I get your point, learning Scheme or Lisp or SML will make you a better programmer in any language, including Java. 

But that's like saying that studying physics will make you a better driver. It surely will, but most pizza-delivering companies simply don't require their drivers to hold a Ph.D. in physics, so *why waste your time* studying physics if you could get the job anyway?

Tellya what, understanding the Theory of Relativity will make you an *even better* programmer. But does that mean that anyone who doesn't understand the Theory of Relativity is a crappy programmer?

Sigh.

My biggest problem with Joel, however, is his whining about 

&gt; CS graduates who are simply not smart enough to work 
&gt; as programmers on anything more sophisticated than 
&gt; Yet Another Java Accounting Application

Sorry, Joel, but such arrogance makes me sick. Last time I checked, you were working on nothing more sophisticated than Yet Another ASP Bugtracking Application. Frankly, you are not in a position to dis anyone.

Yes, I understand that your bugtracking software is the cat's whiskers, and you certainly need brilliant people to make it work for left-handed avocado farmers with Polish keyboards -- but again, writing accounting software that works for left-handed avocado farmers with Polish keyboards is *just* as hard and requires *just* as brilliant programmers.

And again, if hiring brilliant people becomes easy, then you'll have to *compete* against those grep-using recruiters. That will make your life worse, not better."

The Japanese one is obviously counting public holidays (there's almost one a month) as there's no way they get 25 days of annual leave to use a year. More like about 10 days of annual leave.
"More than defense, this article needs a reality check.  No one I know here in northern Italy gets that much vacation - my wife's parents both work in ""state jobs"" and certainly get a lot of vacation, probably a month, all things considered, but not the month and a half that these statistics suggest.

And then we come to the other reality: not many people my age (30) have the sorts of jobs that let you get even that month of vacation.  At most, you might get a month of unpaid leave in August when everything shuts down.

This is the flip side of Italy's social model: it's very hard to fire people once they are entrenched with full fledged contracts, so employers do what they can to avoid hiring people that way.  The result being is that you get some sort of half-baked position that's neither here nor there, often without some of the benefits like the month of vacation.

Something else that's interesting that these stats dont' really show is that a large portion of Italy takes their vacations in the same month - August - when much of northern Italy shuts down.  I view that as being more harmful to productivity than long vacations, because even those who want to work, can't.  And I don't relish the idea of giving up crowded, busy cities to go to crowded, busy, pricey beach towns myself!"

"&gt; i simply refuse to allow my personal morality to be predicated on the promise of ""heaven"" or the threat of ""hell"". thats how you prode animals, not humans.

That shows a pretty major misunderstanding of Chritianity. My personal morality has nothing to do with the promise or heaven or the threat of hell. It has to do with obeying a living God which is much wiser than myself and has never let me down. I've yet to see a command of Christ that doesn't make sense. It is through my own personal experience that not following the law has only led to hardship for me. It seems to me that many of the commands of the Bible are good for living a better life.

I'm glad he had the sense to command me to ""love my neighbor  as myself"", because that in itself sums up any command you could ever make.

I also wasn't aware that animals were prodded with promises of heaven and threats of hell. I mean, when I tell my dog to do something and he won't listen, I don't say, ""If you don't do this, you are going to doggie hell!"" Infact, I don't know anyone that does that. That's kind of weird. ;)

&gt; (a religion as nonsensical as christianity).

And please be a bit more tactful with your words. I understand why some people are atheists. But to say that Christianity is ""nonsensical"" because of some misgivings you may have is pretty hard-headed. I will agree, some Christians live a very nonsensical brand of Christianity, but not all do...the the general assumption that being a Christian means that your brain is somehow disabled irks me quite a bit."

"There is no doubt that a person can be good or evil (and anything in between) regardless of creed, or lack thereof.  The goal of the athiest is simply to question the basic foundations of religion.  Clearly, the Bible and its various interpretations are full of inconsistencies and it makes no sense to base further assumptions on a source which cannot withstand rigorous analysis in the first place.
If historical context cannot be trusted in determining truth, it must be that a religious belief comes from faith alone.  And if it is faith that gives us this strong attachment, what prevents us from simply choosing a different religion, or a different set of beliefs.  To the athiest, this is exactly the relevation.  Since we are free to believe in whatever we choose, why not believe in ourselves?"
"One of the point of JS article, IMHO, is that univertsities seem more interested in giving students the knowledge requested from software companies, than teaching the basics like pointers and recursion.

"&gt; Clearly, the Bible and its various interpretations are full of inconsistencies and it makes no sense to base further assumptions on a source which cannot withstand rigorous analysis in the first place.

Actually, the only reason I'm a Christian is because I did some serious study on Christianity. I refused to have a blind faith - Christ said to love God ""with all your mind, heart and body"". Obviously that implies more than just a blind emotional faith. That being said, I've yet to find anyone who can find a true inconstency with the Bible. Every ""inconsistentcy"" or ""contradiction"" I've ever seen brought forth against the Bible is either a) not reading the text in context or b) not understanding the audience it was written to. I'd love it if you would show me one.

&gt; If historical context cannot be trusted in determining truth, it must be that a religious belief comes from faith alone.

And the Bible has shown time and time again that it is an accurate historical record. An example: Sir William Ramsay was a respected archaelogist who lived at the end of the 19th century. He was an atheist who ascribed to the theory that the Book of Acts was a product of made up stories produced in the 3rd century. Using the Bible as source text, he set out around the Mediterranean intend on disproving it.  In the process of trying to show that the Biblical stories were made up, he found that the Bible was a remarkably accurate historical text. He suprised everyone when he returned home and wrote his book *St. Paul the Traveller and Roman Citizen* in which he stated, ""Great historians are the rarest of writers...[I regard Luke] among the historians of the first rank"".

Did Hitler not believe in himself? Did Jeffrey Dahmer not believe in himself? If we have no ultimate authority on what is right or wrong, what business do you have telling the murderer that he is doing wrong? Perhaps he is only doing what he believes right (see Hitler).

I think there is a bit of misunderstanding on what exactly faith is. Faith doesn't necessarily imply one without evidence. You place faith/trust in your friends or certain people because they have shown you that they are reliable. Faith is placed on court decisions not because there is absolute proof that something has happened, but rather because the evidence is too great to ignore. The same goes for the Christian. You don't have to put blinders on to believe in God. Infact, God wants you to seek him out and look for the evidence that he is there. It is the only reason I am a Christian - I have seen historically and in my own life time and time again evidences of God.

"Well, to begin with, the translation they are using is the King James version, which is not very accurate. The KJV was based off of manuscripts from the 10th century AD and later, where as modern translations come from texts dating as far back as the 3rd and 4th centuries. Understanding of ancient Biblical Hebrew and Greek has also obviously increased since 1600 (when the KJV was written) as well.

For example, one of the verses they cite, Deuteronomy 4:40, in the KJV reads, ""That thou mayest prolong **thy days upon the earth**, which the Lord thy God giveth thee for ever."". Where as in the NIV it reads, ""Keep his decrees and commands, which I am giving you today, so that it may go well with you and your children after you and that you may **live long in the land** the LORD your God gives you for all time."" Now obviously these people aren't going to live forever and thus be able to live in the land forever, but it is a symbolic representation of God's covenant with Israel.

Deuteronomy 4:40 is not referring to the earth as a planet, but rather as the land the Israelites knew. This rendering also fits in the context of the verse, where Moses is speaking to the Israelites about their future in the land of Canaan.

Anyway, their first example is an excellent example of not looking at the verses in context with the rest of the Bible. Yes, the current earth will be destroyed, but verses such as Isaiah 56 speak of ""a new heavens and a new earth"" (actually, they reference this one). So while the current version of the earth will not always be around, earth itself will, and that's what the verses provided are getting at.

Another example they provide, which is ""is dancing a sin"" is a great example of taking the verses out of context. For example, they reference Exodus 32, which says, ""And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp, that he saw the calf, and the dancing: and Moses' anger waxed hot.... And Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people unto thee, that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them?""

They actually italicize dancing as if it is the sin of the Israelites, but in the context of the entire passage, that is obviously not the case. The act of dancing wasn't sinful, it was the act of worshipping the golden calf which was sinful. I'm actually very suprised they even tried to call this an inconsistency because its *really* stretching it to call it one. The same goes with the other verses they referenced to try and show that the Bible says dancing is sin.

I could keep going with these examples, but I think I have provided enough to show some of the major problems with these so-called ""inconsistencies"". One thing that should be known about Ecclesiastes is it by nature is a very contradictory book. Solomon (the author) praises different actions and desires and in the very next sentence will speak of how worthless they are. Basically alluding to the fact on how great things are at first but how they quickly lose their luster. That's why by the end of the book, you see him make a succinct summary, ""Now all has been heard; here is the conclusion of the matter: Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the whole duty of man.""

But again, most of these alleged contradictions would not even be pointed out if critics would take the time to read many of the passages in context instead of isolating sentences and trying to make them read what they aren't. I mean, The Bible actually says, ""there is no God""...but if you read the entire verse in context, it reads, ""The fool says there is no God"". Obviously you can see the problem with chosing one verse out of a collection of 66 books and trying to interpret the verse just by itself."

Why exactly would even the Jewish rabbis mention Christ (albeit negatively) in the Talmud if he didn't exist? That in itself should be the first proof that whatever claims are being made is bunk - as there are several extra-Biblical sources that mention Christ, the Talmud being only one of them.

Its debatable as to whether Christ really was who he said he was...but to go as far as to say that not only he didn't exist, but the Gospel accounts are based off of completely misidentifying a person is ludicrous."

"When you are sailing and just starting to get a little speed there is a wide angle around where the wind is coming called the ""no-go zone"", simply because if you face it you will go nowhere fast. After you pick up speed that angle shrinks because your momentum nullifies fringe effects of the wind acting upon you, so you can tighten up your angle and face a little more into the wind (but never completely into it). 

So his analogy is that the wind is the big problem and the more you get to work on the problem (the more velocity you pick up) the more directly you can face it, even if you never can face it directly."

Indead.
"Denouncing really can refer to an entire range of things. I wonder where you get the idea that its ""only available to the radibly fanatical"". Denouncing could be anything from ""his works are incorrect"" to ""he's burning in hell"". I mean, really...it could go from one extreme to another.

I quick look-up on the literal definition (not that it really matters):

1.  To condemn openly as being evil or reprehensible. See Synonyms at criticize.
2. To accuse formally.
3. To give formal announcement of the ending of (a treaty).

Robbie, aren't you ""comdemning openly"" those who are ""rabidly fanatical""? Should we take you to court for that? Oddly enough, in doing the same thing you are condemning...are you now a ""radidly fanatical"" person also?

I do not literally mean what I just said, but your snap judgement on the situation when the article isn't very specific is a little off. The whole trial seems more than a little bizarre. A priest denounces (this could mean a myriad of things) a man who is denouncing the person of Jesus Christ, so now the man takes the priest to court and is sueing him? And on top of that the judge wants the priest to prove Jesus Christ exists? Like I said, the whole thing sounds ridiculous and bizarre. And for the record, I'm not a Roman Catholic if anyone feels like trying to use that against me.

&gt; I guess you as a Christian know better, are obviously a better person then me (and Hitler).

Why the snide remarks? Where did I even imply that in anything I've written?

&gt; Because I believe in myself I can not hold a moral code right? That seems to be your arguement. You are so wrapped up in defending your faith you forget that faith is an individual thing.

First of all, what exactly does ""believing in yourself mean""? And again, if faith is an individual thing, then we have no right to condemn murderers, rapists, racists...really anything we condemn today. If its all a personal thing, who is to say what is right and wrong?

That said, the case really is pretty wierd.  
Here is a somewhat coherent translation from italian of a filing by  Luigi Cascioli: (It's from a site that bears his name, so a grain of salt may be in order): http://www.luigicascioli.it/12processo_eng.php
And here is a purported translation of luigi's initial letter of complaint:
http://www.christianism.com/html/notes/8note57.html

It seems that the article really does explain about all there is to the case.  Righi says that Jesus existed, Cascioli thinks not, and sued him under something that sounds like an anti-propaganda law.  Maybe it is something 
left over from WWII?  I believe that Germany has some laws that forbid certain forms of expression as propaganda or something-perhaps that is where this law comes from?

As a side note, calling Christ's divinity debatable is a bit of a stretch.  It is demonstrably believable for at least some people, but it is not really something on which there can be much of any true debate."
"A rather extensive treatment on this phenomenon can be found in Freakonomics, by the way."
"you know i think these statistics are made up

"This speech mostly deals with society's capacity for acting based on fear rather than information. We should take Crichton's message as a warning and nothing more. No matter the issue, the questions remain the same:

1) What do we know?
2) What can we do with what we know?

Hopefully Crichton's writings provoke people to ask these questions about global warming. Despite his polemics, I'm sure that even he would be pleased if people took it upon themselves to learn about the science behind the headlines."
"When I criticize the Chrichton essay as uninformed, I do not mean that I think that the author is stupid (or short a graduate degree) -- I do mean that the structure of his argument is such that it appears to refute and/or falsify theories related to global warming while cleverly refusing to provide any information at all.  

Absurd generalizatoins -- approaching an undeclared general theory of warnings -- are pointed to for evidence that climate change warnings are baseless.  For example:

""One interesting feature is the tendency to reversals: a benefit becomes a hazard and then becomes a benefit again. Butter is good, then bad, then good again. Saccharine is good, then bad, then good.""

Why not generalize from our experiences with asbestos and lead to reach the opposite conclusion?  There is no meat to the argument.  

Where is the counter-evidence?  It sounds like it's coming ... I kept waiting for it ... but the closest we get is news that the saccharine hullabaloo came to nothing.  No new evidence, and a silly, invalid form of argument: That is what I mean by uninformed."
"Cascioli says ""that there are not other records of Christ other than the Biblical account"". Very easy proof of that being false is that Christ is mentioned in the Talmud. The fact that Christ was mentioned in other nonBiblical sources really is not debatable.

The Bible has shown time and time again to be an accurate account of history. People debated that the Hittites ever existed (they were mentioned in the Bible). Lo and behold, their civilization was discovered around the end of the 19th century. People debated if Pilate ever existed...a cornerstone that says, ""Potius Pilate, procurator of the Jews"" has been found in ancient Caeseara Phillippi. As I stated in another post, Sir William Ramsay was an atheist who set out using the Book of Acts as his guidebook at disprove it and show that it was a product of 3rd century myths. He began excavating in the Mediterranean and suprised everyone when he came back and made the comment in his book, ""I consider Luke a historian of the first rank"".

If Christ did not exist, the Jewish rabbis (they had more reason that anyone to say that he didn't exist) would not have mentioned them in the Talmud. Instead of denying that he existed, they attribute his actions to being a bastard child, being a sorceror, etc. Josephus mentions Christ (altough the lengths to which he does are albeit debatable). Tacitus, a Roman historian, mentions Christ.

By 64 AD, Nero was already blaming things on a new religious group, the Christians, which implies that the religion necessarily began earlier. John and other writers claimed to be first-hand witnesses of Christ, and then went out and preached this gospel for absolutely no gain and were stoned, crucified, and mocked for this gospel. If you know for a fact that something is a lie...how often is it that a man is willing to die for that lie?

I could mention many evidences, but the simple truth is...if Christ did not exist a tall, the Jewish rabbis (who again, would love to deny that he existed anyway), would not have bothered writing about him in the Talmud. Why would you make negative statements about a man who never existed?

So again, if Christ was indeed just a misidentified person, then not only did the Christians do the misidentifying, but the leading Jewish religious leaders did as well. And I can assure you, the Jews would not be confusing their heretics.

And John of Gamala? A quick Google on his name reveals a bunch of fiction books with him as a leader character. There are no scholarly sources that mention him. If anything, it would seem that he was the one who did not exist.

Something else I wanted to add: for the disciples to completely fabricate the story of Jesus makes absolutely no sense at all. They added detailst that would have severly restricted the popularity of the religion. For example...the Gospel accounts attribute divinity to Jesus, a man. This was completely contrary to the Jewish idea of God as an invisible all-powerful force. Infact, the Jews were so opposed to setting limits to God, that they wouldn't even write his name. For the disciples to fabricate the story of Christ as actually being God would have been pretty much a suicidal way to start their religion in the eyes of the Jews. In addition, Christ would not have been a popular God in the eyes of the Romans who did not have a positive view of the Jews and who had powerful gods such as Jupiter. This story of a Jewish god dying on the cross, embarassing himself by being naked and defecating on himself would not have been attractive to any Romans. And something that would not have been attractive to either Roman or Jew was the account by each Gospel that the first person to reach Christ's grave and to discover he was missing was a woman. This would be seen as making a woman a witness (ie, highly accountable) and was not something that happened in either society. There are many more examples of things like these, but in short, Christianity is the exact opposite of the type of religion you just make up. There are so many unnecessary and seemingly negative details in the Gospel accounts that its just laughable to suppose that the man of Jesus was a myth. It spread in spite of itself, not because of itself.

Again, you can debate the divinity of Christ all day, but to act like he didn't even exist is just ludicrous."
"I happened to find what the case is about from Cascioli's own site:

""According to article 661 of the Italian Penal Code, there is an abuse of popular credulity when someone, by means of fraud, deceives a great number of people. In this particular case, the ministers of religion of the Catholic Church, like Righi in the present case, by committing historical falsity, therefore presenting invented facts as if true and actually occurred â but useful to religious doctrine â they deceive all the people that come into contact with the teachings of such religion, by inducing them to believe in that religion, not on the basis of purely theological reasoning (totally legitimate and admissible), but on the basis of a deceptive representation of the facts.""

I was thinking it would be interesting if Cascioli had to prove that John of Gamala existed as well. Because otherwise isn't he doing the same thing he is sueing someone for if John of Gamala did not exist?"

"I am in quality, and productivity in my area of concern is not considered by others as a choice but a must. I have no choice but to muster the energy from somewhere to meet those demands.

But, like everyone else I allso procrastinate. I have developed over a period of time, a habit, so to speak, whereby I have allready measured my capability of meeting the before date of the deadline, whether it is my own or for the company that I work for. In other words I allow myself to procrastinate for a period of time before the whistle blows. This can be measured in days to weeks.

However, this is probably my downfall in terms of productivity, because there should be a balance. A simplistic example, 'If you eat to much, you get sick', as with drinking. As my companion allways says, 'Too much of anything is not good'. I however love to procrastinate. I do alot of creative thinking in this area.

Actually at the end of the day, I don't think that anyone in a 'work for money senario' has any choice, but to be productive. Money is what make the world tick.

On a more serious note, a comment that I read stated that one must tackle a problem by Identifying and breaking up the area of concern so as to be able to understand it better and therefore to enable positive productivity. This is definitely a good approach.

"Again, the Jesus that was invented (assuming he was) would have been the most illogical thing created. He would not be appealing to the Romans or the Jews, and the idea that the ""religion invented Jesus"" goes against the culture of the societies in which Christianity spread at the time.

The truth is, most of you probably don't doubt that Buddha or Muhammad existed. But when it comes to Christ, it all of a sudden becomes a very debatable issue.

The website you have provided offers very little evidence to what you are claiming. Sure, it offers the words of ""scholars"", but I could list just as many scholars to you that believe that Christ did exist. Something that should make you question how valid that site is is very few of the men listed are historians. People such as Voltaire are listed who had an absolute rabid hatred of Christianity. Voltaire was so hypocritical as to condemn Christians for crimes they committed against others (and rightly so), and then rejoiced when churches were destroyed and Christians were murdered during the French Revolution.

Yeah, your site lists people like Ralph Waldo Emerson, but as great of a writer he was, he is certainly not someone you go to for historical matters. There are very few real historians that doubt that Christ existed. If they doubt anything, it is whether or not he was divine."

"It's an interesting article but like many of the people who have commented here, I disagree with much of what he says.  Two things stand out in particular: first, I don't think most people live in fear.  I think most people live in a cocoon of blissful ignorance perpetuated by media, government and experts who always try to make it sound like everything is in control and that there isn't much to worry about (i.e., they sound like Crichton in this lecture).

Second, I disagree with his characterization of complex systems that can only be ""managed"", not controlled.  This is the rationale we always get for why globalism, for example, is unstoppable.  It's a ""complex system"" so we need to manage it, because we can't control it.  In other words, we can't control our own destiny, because it's too complicated.  We need to sit back and ""manage"" things, not try to change things, according to Crichton."

"Michael Crichton should shut his mouth and stick to writing bad books.

What really struck me about his lecture is the similarity between many of the examples he gives and what he is doing himself: playing off of uninformed hype to enrich/empower oneself.

Despite the footnotes he is either uninformed or a liar.

His whole idea of complex and linear systems is incorrect. 
Two examples he gives of linear systems (a rocket and a cannonball) are in fact non-linear. Linear systems are proportional (if the input is changed the output changes by a proportional ammount) and additive (the output in response to the sum of two inputs is exactly the sum of the outputs in response to the inputs individually). Ojects moving in a gravitational field do not meet these requirements even if you ignore friction. Dip into high-school physics, pull out the basic equations for kinetic and potential energy, and consider the relationship between initial velocity and height reached by the cannonball. If you can't see the non-linearity there perhaps you should go buy one of Crichton's books...

Enough beating a dead horse.

What he is really talking about seems to be non-deterministic systems, which aren't as unpredictable as he wants. If it weren't possible to predict to some degree of accuracy the behavior of non-deterministic systems we could achieve nothing.

He seems to demand total predictability which is a real jack-a$$ thing to do, right along the lines of the creationists (ID'ers). He contends that complex systems can only be managed. Management requires some ability to expect a result from a cetain action, which is prediction. So by his argument, since complex systems can't be predicted, and management requires prediction, management of complex systems is impossible. Does he even think this stuff through? Although to be fair, his idea of management and predictions are probably different.

He also seems to be engaging in some intellectual dishonesty by showing the headline and first few words of the Independent's ""Future of the Earth"" article and implying that the article is an example of people playing on fear. From the way it starts I wager that the article is actually along the lines of his argument, not an actual fear-mongering piece. I can't verify since the Independent wants a Pound to purchase the article...

Another thing, doctors, especially MD's are not scientists automaticaly. They are technicians who apply the findings of science. Some doctors are scientists, they do research. The rest are like mechanics, they try to figure out a problem and fix it (at a gross level), not experiment to find explanations for the problem. Oversimplifying here: there is some cross-over between general practice medicine and the practice of science, the same can be said of mechanics. However, having an MD, PhD, or an ASE certification doesn't mean you know crap about an unrelated field.

Has it really? Can you point me to the study that demonstrates this? I always thought that advertising of this nature was very effective. Similar ones relating to smoking have put me off cigarettes.
"It's easy to point out that advertising like this doesn't work 100% of the time.  Sure people will see this and still drink and drive.  But, it's a lot harder to track how many see it and either swear off drinking and driving, keep friends from doing so, or even just drive drunk less frequently...

Also, I'd say it isn't so much that ""becoming hideous is a stronger argument than dying,"" as much as it is that the shock-value of the message sticks with the viewer more strongly.  For me, I have been exposed to death so much in the media, that seeing another pretty (or average or ugly) face who has died barely gets my attention (sad to say).  This, on the other hand, is the raw reality of what can come of the foolishness that is driving drunk, presented in a way I can't ignore."

Killing someone is stopping the show. Turning her life into permanent physical and psychological intense suffering, turning her into a impotent being that causes horror to everyone, especially her beloved ones, without hope for any significant improvement ever, is letting it go only for worse. 

I know it's not PC to say that not every life ought to be lived, but would you argue that removing bad times from one's life while keeping all of the good ones isn't a good thing? In her case, that would have been simple to achieve: let her die on that day, as she'll probably never any significant good time anymore.

Moreover, death being something unavoidable in the long term, we came to be more or less used to it, and we can sort of cope with the idea. Quite fortunately, we aren't used to what happened to her, we're still fresh to this kind of horror, and we better realize its terrible nature

So yes, I think that what happened to her is far worse than death, that it is normal that it causes much more horror than the death of, say, her carmates, and that it IS a much stronger argument than someone dying.

"From the page I linked to there is a link to the PDF of the report the list was gleaned from. It states:

1. What is the Corruption Perceptions Index?
The TI Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) ranks countries in terms of the degree to which corruption is
perceived to exist among public officials and politicians. It is a composite index, drawing on corruptionrelated
data in expert surveys carried out by a variety of reputable institutions. It reflects the views of
business people and analysts from around the world, including experts who are locals in the countries
evaluated.

On the site I linked to, they already describe in detail how difficult it is to gather information on corruption under question 5:

5. Can the costs of corruption be quantified?
The short answer is ""no"". Some experts use regression analyses and other empirical methods in order to try to put a dollar figure on the cost of corruption. It is virtually impossible, though, since payments of bribes are not publicly recorded. No one knows exactly how much money is being ""invested"" in corrupt officials annually. And bribes do not take only monetary form: favours, services, presents and so on are just as common. At most, one can research the correlation between the level of corruption and, say, democratisation, economic development or environmental degradation.The social costs of corruption are even less quantifiable. No one knows how much the loss of an energetic entrepreneur or an acclaimed scientist costs a country. Moreover, any estimated social costs in dollars would be inadequate to the task of measuring the human tragedy behind resignation, illiteracy, or inadequate medical care. A general scepticism vis-Ã -vis any attempt at quantifying the costs of corruption is thus warranted.The following example illustrates the dilemma of pressing the issue into facts and figures:
A power plant is being built somewhere in the world, at a cost of US$ 100 million. It could be argued that - were it not for corruption - the cost could have been as low as US$ 80 million. The financial damage to the public would then be US$ 20 million. In practice, quite often projects are planned simply so that those involved can make huge private profits. Assuming that the power plant was superfluous, the financial damage would have to be assessed at US$ 100 million. Yet no major construction project leaves the environment untouched. The results may be: increased pollution, a lowering of land prices, resettlement of local residents, an increased debt burden for the country, etc. This calculation - probably closest to reality - is immensely complex. On a global scale, it seems almost impossible. But even if one were able to calculate the environmental damage, the increase of the debt burden and other factors, how would one measure the erosion of public confidence and the deterioration of a government's legitimacy, which are the direct result of corruption?

In my perception, you've taken a defensive stance against this data since it triggered your bogometer. However, the site I linked to fully described the potential for bogus data and stresses the difficulty you're concerned about. Whether the actual list is useful or not, it certainly got me to read their site to see how they came up with the data and now I find myself understanding corruption a bit more. That's kinda useful to me."

"We're still animals, with a survival instinct often so strong that we couldn't find the force to terminate ourselves, althought there's no hope for anything worth it in our future.

Wishing one were dead is one thing. Finding the mental force to act accordingly to your will and reason, rather than obey your instincts, is another. Which is often not a bad thing: many people will, at a time or another in their lives, wrongly estimate that they're doomed, and they're saved by their programmed ""cowardise"" toward suicide.

Besides, in the case discussed here, when you're impotent, almost limbless, and permanently high with the strongest painkillers medicine can provide, there are technical barriers to commiting suicide."

"It's not an argument, just an example.  How drunk was the driver in question?  What were the circumstances of the incident? Moreover, what percentage of accidents are due to alcohol (honestly due--the current figures are reputedly very loose; e.g. striking a drunk 'cause one was talking on one's cell phone counts as an alcohol-related injury or death)?

Yes, this was a truly terrible incident.  Terrible incidents happen all the time--arms are removed in threshing machines, men die in industrial accidents and so forth.  The question is what is a reasonable and prudent way to reduce the frequency of terrible incidents.  Here in Colorado the limit is .05--not IMHO a reasonable or prudent limit.  Sure, anyone with a .2 BAC has too much; probably .1 is pretty bad as well.  But .01, like MADD wish to drop it to?"

When the situation becomes too bad at movie theaters Im sure some enterprising new theaters will spring up that want to provide a good movie watching environment (but there are probably problems with licensing films).

"Most drunk drivers do not cause any accident.  Executing them would be a much larger tragedy than the less frequent damage they cause.

The title is good evidence of the sense of theatre of the poster, or their lack of judgement, or both.

Most car accidents do not involve alcohol.  My understanding is that excessive speed is a implicated more often.  Other issues are inattention (stereos, phones), fatigue, inexperience, poor judgement, other drugs etc.

If this is an argument against drinking and driving, then it is an equally strong argument against driving at all.

People make mistakes.  With cars those mistakes sometimes have high costs.

Acceptance of cars involves acceptance of risk.  If the risk of occasionally drinking and driving is unacceptable then risks of driving is too.

I don't drink drive.  I do occasionally exceed the posted speed limit, not stop completely at stop signs, listen to music, briefly answer the phone etc.  It's a personal choice not a moral absolute.  I should not be executed and neither should any other person.

But lets take this one step farther. So what about people who drive dangerously because they have a cell phone in one hand, a coffee in the other, and are changing lanes? What about people who speed because they are late to miss the school bus? What about people who speed to get to a doctors appointment? FAR MORE PEOPLE are killed by speeders than by drunks.

I'm all for heavy ads, because I DO think they will reach a subset of the drunk-driving-population. And I'm for stiff penalties.

OK, I'll admit that anything's possible, but a racist joke? Are we supposed to believe that a group of white supremacist (or at least incredibly tasteless and insensitive) programmers lurking within Wal-Mart's IT department deliberately skewed the recommendation system to produce this particular combination? I'd say this falls under the category of ""extraordinary claims"". And what does ""bad judgement"" have to do with it? The only ""judgement"" at work is that of an automated system working in a problem domain that was clearly beyond its abilities. Besides which, they already *did* explain, and *did* apologize -- profusely. So let's save the outrage for where it really belongs, please.

"Didn't the dot com bubble last something like 4 years? (from '96 to '00)  So saying you predicted it but you were just 3 years early means you would've missed most of the boom (had you acted accordingly).

However, I do think that housing prices are due for a correction.  I can only see two beneficiaries of the current housing 'boom' : real estate agents, mortage brokers and local governments that base property taxes on a percentage of property value.  So what if my house has gone up in value by 50% in the last four years?  If I sold my house I'd still need someplace to live, so either: 1) I'd have to buy another house (which has also gone up at least by the same percentage meaning that I really can't capture the gain) or 2) I'd have to rent and because housing prices have gone up, so have rents (landlords need to cover those mortage payments). The article claims that rents haven't gone up, but certainly they have in some areas pricing low income people out of the rental market.  In areas where rents haven't gone up it might make sense to go for option 2 (sell and rent until the bubble pops) because you could perhaps capture some of the gain.

So what real benefit have I gotten as a homeowner by rising real estate prices?  I pay more in property taxes now and other people around me who rent are paying more in rent (meaning they have less money to spend on other things).  It's the Real Estate agents who have played a big role in talking up this market.  Bring on the correction, lower prices will be good for those who don't yet own homes and they won't hurt those of us who have been in our homes for several years (it's going to hurt for those who have bought in the last couple of years, though; they'll have to consider it an expensive lesson in buying high and selling low)."

"Well, this is US-specific, so I can't judge too well, but one thing of the analysis seemed strange to me, and that's when he said that the normal situation is that rent is higher than mortgage payment. That's not, and has never been, the situation where I live (Spain) and it strikes me as a weird arrangement. When you're renting you're paying every month and don't get anything at the end, why would you pay more for less? If I were to choose whether to rent or mortgage and mortgaging were cheaper, what would be the advantage of renting that would justify me paying more? I just don't get this.

"There's nothing to refute since you didn't describe what you mean by 'we all fail', 'whatever maximises your companies expected value', or 'optimal for society'.

"Um, rent is *always* higher than the mortage payment.  The difference is profit to the landowner.  If the landlord's payment to the bank (his mortgage payment) was lower than the tenant's rent, the landlord would make no profit, and would therefore have no incentive to rent the building. 

The author is saying that during a housing market crash, the rent prices fall below what the landlord pays for his mortgage payment, and the landlord ends up owing more to the bank than the he gets in rent from the tenant.

*Most* people rent instead of buy because they don't have enough money for a downpayment for a mortgage.

I don't know her, and I'm projecting some of my personnal views on her: that's exactly the purpose of her mediatization. 

Maybe she's disgusted with life, maybe she spends her lifetime dreaming she was dead on that day, maybe she feels definitely lost for sane social interaction, for bearing and rising kids, surely her life is a permanent physical suffering, probably does she rightly bet that this suffering will only end with her death. Maybe she sees little purpose in her surviving, and has little hope to find such a purpose in the future.

Or maybe she thinks that what she endures is God's will, that it has an Inneffable meaning, that demonstrating her outstanding courage is of crucial importance, maybe she loves her medicalised life, with it's suffering, horrors, etc. just as Job did on his manure heap. 

I have as little (or as much) ground to claim the former as you have to claim the latter. I certainly wouldn't hold the same speach, had she personnaly taken part in the discussion, but here she's only a substrate, on which we grow a discussion or more general interest, so we don't have to care too much about betraying her philosophical stand, had she one. 

However, I strongly disagree with your claim that ""She has endured horrific pain and agony in order to LIVE"". I've been living with an intensive care doctor, and I've got no illusion about who fights for survival: doctors do whatever it takes to keep people technically alive, with little to no consideration for the kind of life it might be. They give no opportunity to the patient to choose between life and death.  I would add that many doctors do it as a _Wille zur Macht_ move (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nietzsche), which is awfully ungodly if you look at it from a religious standpoint, and cursed such prominent figures as Moses.

Bottom line is: if you didn't make a conscious choice, then there is no courage involved. Nothing indicates that she ever had an opportunity to make a choice, and my experience with physicians makes me strongly believe that she never had one.

A bit of philosophy/theology to finish. You write: ""She is a human being and a courageous survivor. To me, that is beautiful"". I've already written what I think of this courage. About her being a survivor, what does it mean? The end of her life is indeed slightly delayed (she's going to suffer skin cancers, immunodepressions, general bad health due to lack of physical activity, various other organic dysfunctions, and probably a lack of reasons to enjoy life, so don't expect her to live very old). I would find it beautiful if these years were put to use into something that surpasses her personnal life. Merely staying alive isn't exactly such a sublime thing, my dog would do the same. Your life's only worth what you make of it. 

I really don't buy the ""this is a beautiful proof of courage"" thing: that's mumbo-jumbo repeated by religious people to cover how difficult it is to see God's will, in a world which has always seemed unfair, and where now humanity's power grows at such insane speed that most of theological views become obsolete instantaneous (a couple of decades _is_ instantaneous, for theology). What was God's will: the crash? Her survival? The conditions of this survival? Doctors being able and willing to maintains her alive? Why would this very high-tech, artificial, survival medical effort be godly, whereas, say, articifial fecundation or contraception would be ungodly? Can I remind you that until no-so-long ago, opening corpses to improve medical knowledge and power was considered as terribly ungodly, and would grant you death by burning? The whole standpoint of ethics (including religion) about survival has been blown by the pace of medical progress. It will take decades before we adapt our ethics to these new conditions. That won't be too much of a heartbreak for secular ethics; OTOH religious views which pretend to be eternal will suffer much more from that twist...

Sure if you bought property specifically to rent it out at a profit, your rent is gonna be higher, but I think its more likely to be a long term investment rather then short term profit decision.

"This is very concerning indeed. What is needed is similar applications with tighter access controls set by the maker of the profile.

Its understandable that since the entire business models of these sites relies on them having as much info as possible about you for targeted advertising, these sites provide possibly the **most accurate** and **easiest to use** resource for mining information about groups of people.

Fears of some NSA/ government conspiracies aside, the potential for abuse of these systems has already been proven. Private schools have gone apeshit in in the last year doing things like registering on facebook and looking for anything, even simply thoughts or jokes that could be interpreted as violating school policy. This is a huge problem. I would be surprised if government agencies don't start using this information to screen new hires.

In the short term I would suggest that you DONT use your real name to register for sites like facebook.. since they are nice enough to not let you change it after. From experience I'll let you know that otherwise you'll have to use it knowing that everything you write, your pictures, groups, and friends can and will be monitored by your school.. and possibly others.

An example, recently some friends of mine were nearly suspended just for being in a group that mentioned drinking on campus. I can here some of you now whining that that's no big deal, but just think of how much this could cost the students. A year of tuition, hundreds of hours of community service (which is as expensive as overtime given that he is already busy), new living expenses, etc. The potential of private schools to censor and penalize students for communication that is intended to be PRIVATE amoung themselves is rapidly increasing.

Now you would expect that since fb has a number of privacy measures (mostly through limiting visibility of profiles), it would be a much more creative and relaxed environment. Well it isn't, and it's boring as heck unless your writing cute little love letters to all your friends. It's gotten much worse lately as many have realized that whatever they write, the wrong people will find out about it. This is a direct failure of the privacy mechanisms that the site setup to, i think, lessen this fear.

If you look at the other side of the spectrum, myspace, were your name is whatever you want, everyone writes all about their drunken sex parties, and even slip porn in now and then, you'll see something closer to the creative and fun place that the net could provide. Not to mention that everyone doesn't seem so scared. Too bad the site is focused on 10yo girls..

So, why am I complaining so much and what can be done about it? My idea, which I have roughly implemented, is as follows.  Basically my solution is to create a trust based authentication system. For example in a system similar to these sites, the visibility of Bob's profile could be degraded based on the amount that Bob and/or Bob's friends trusts the viewer, Alice. For the most part everything would be transparent except that Bob would now be able to rate his friends in different categories such as trustworthiness and then optionally tune these ranking thresholds to correspond to levels of visibility. Of course the challenge of this is making it totally distributed and backed by crypto to ensure that the rules are followed regardless of subpoenas.. which my implementation demonstrates. I've drafted up a few papers, and have plenty of implementation code if anyone wants to take a look.

So what does everyone else think? Anyone with better ideas? Or maybe your all happy living in a glass house.. I'm sure that anyone that has done extensive non-business communication online has been bitten when the wrong person read things you wrote that weren't intended for her.

For me, this isn't a fundamentalist/atheist argument.  It's more a question of how to manage the multitude of diverse opinions on topics that must be taught in schools.  Unless something is an absolute fact, we should include the most commonly held views as those that should be taught, making sure to mention that there are other points of view that are different.

As such, I believe there should be at least one other option mentioned when it comes to ""how we got here.""  Obviously, whether you believe it or not (I don't), the Theory of Evolution deserves to have the lion's share of time devoted to it.  However, there should be mention that there are other points of view.  I'm surprised that, since there are so many people in this country who claim to believe in God, there wouldn't be more than a passing interest in the concept of ID.

When we talk about the separation of church and state, we usually think about it meaning that the church is not to be the state.  We definitely bend over backwards to make sure of that-- just look at all the Christmas/Channukah/""holiday"" debates we just came out of a week ago.  However, we also should look at the other side of the coin there-- the state is not to be the church.  And when you talk about the origin of the world, you are engaging in both scientific and religious terms.

Many people would love to be able to send their children to a religious school.  However, those who want to do so face a major handicap:  they must pay for their child's education while the tax money they have contributed goes to a public school.  I don't want to turn this into a voucher debate (one controversial topic at a time, please!), but this problem does make it more difficult for ""regular"" people to send their kids to a religious school than to a public one.

"The article's author comments on being a wage slave with his youthful experience of 26 years, and it shows.  Let's quickly visit some ""nuggets"" of wisdom:

""Common programmers may expect to earn at least $60,000/year, but it is rare for even superstar programmers to command above $150,000, excepting very specialized markets like kernel driver development.""

The 60k to 150k range for an annual salary is characteristic of a career to which the property ""slave"" is attached?  Interesting.

""But in taking the full risk and reward of the enterprise upon himself, the programmer who is not sorely wanting in skills of business development or marketing must soon find himself enjoying the fruits of his labors, albeit many times only after years of difficult and uncertain unpaid labor.""

It is astonishing to find that this is held as some sort of dreamlike gold standard.  Mr. Weekly apparently has failed to consider the depth to which ""years of difficult and uncertain unpaid labor"" might cause many individuals to be satisfied with their 60k-150k salaries.  Some of them might even have responsibilities such as student loan payments, mortgages, or families to take care of.

Oh, what the hell.  Quit your job anyway.  Duties be damned, there's a pot of gold at the end of that rainbow!

""Wages and debt go hand in hand, for creditors only make loans which can be repaid regularly. Therefore, the single most important question they ask when ascertaining credit is one's present wages.""

Mr. Weekly is quite unfamiliar with the FICO credit score, which has NO direct reference to one's income. Bankers do care about income, but they care far more about your fidelity to their debts. The theory goes: If you've reliably met your financial obligations in the past, you'll probably meet them again in the future, regardless of income.

It's a pretty good theory.

--

As far as the actual heart of the article goes, Mr. Weekly seriously devalues and brushes aside the invaluable work performed by the rest of a company to which a programmer gives his allegiance.  I think many project managers, executive officers, salesmen, and marketers would object to the fact that a mere sprinkling of their skills is all that is necessary to turn a decent piece of software into what the author implies is a near unlimited, wage-free source of wealth.

But at least he encourages the reader to avoid wanton debt.  That's worth something, I suppose."

"Putting everyone in single cells would cost a lot of money. Convicted felons can't vote, and they don't usually attract a lot of sympathy from voters. Besides, the prison world is out of sight and out of mind for most people, except when something dramatic and newsworthy happens. So the people in charge, at every level, have a strong incentive to follow the path of least resistance and least expense. Who cares what the prisoners do to each other, so long as there's no big riot or fire or a string of deaths? Even attacks on prison officers are not dealt with seriously in some prison regimes.

And even with the best will in the world, forcing large groups of convicted criminals together for long periods, bored and in isolation from the rest of the world, and then trying to stop them from forming a poisonous subculture is ridiculously hard."

"I am the author. I'm now a downright grizzly old man of 27. I'm pretty amused by how quickly some people latched onto my age and decided to brush aside anything I had to say as a result, because I clearly (in their eyes) couldn't have possibly lived long enough to be able to bring insight into the labor market without a few decades of work experience.

I realize that plenty of people are risk averse and recognize the comforts that a $60k+ / year job provide. Those people can live a reasonable lifestyle, enjoy their jobs, and find life content. The economy is largely composed of such people and absolutely requires these people.

But there are some people who have it in them to go it on their own, and they owe it to themselves (and society) to make a try at it. These people are a little less risk-averse, are interested in developing a broader skillset, etc. Some of this is luck (to not be covered in crushing debt) and some of this is chutzpah (or hubris, as you please).

As for my brushing aside of the value of the other players in the company - I think it's a reaction to the fact that executive management and salespeople already effectively operate on commission. If the company does well, they do well. But the same is not generally true of the engineering staff. And only engineers capable of acting in a founder-style role and having ownership over their ideas will be able to see the sorts of returns that executives and salespeople are regularly able to achieve.

And if enough engineers leave to start their own ventures, management at larger companies may consider giving engineers a larger ownership of the company as retention strategy. Until there is market pressure to do so, however, we're unlikely to see significant ownership on the part of the engineers and innovators who are creating a company's core property."

2. I understand your analogy; it's really obvious, isn't it? But I disagree with it. In fact, economists find it pretty annoying when their field is misconstrued as blind faith in the Invisible Hand. Read this: http://cafehayek.typepad.com/hayek/2005/12/market_utopians.html
Economics is not based on belief in a power we cannot understand. It is based on complex systems, something we know we *can* understand. To the naive observer, complex systems seem to be magic: the human brain is so complex it leads many people to believe an intelligence must have designed it. But the human brain isn't magic, and neither is the economy. Economists know this stuff - it's their job, after all! Read the book ""Reinventing the Bazaar"" for a good look at some areas in which economists admit the market fails, and a statist solution must be implemented."

"I rang Starbucks once and asked them why they did this - they said there ""wasn't room"" on the menu to fit the short sizes in. Ha!

Anyway, this is rather old news - other papers have covered the Starbucks short issue. Personally I think his explanation is weak. But what this guy leaves out is a crucial fact: how to get served this short size coffee. Starbucks staff are told: if someone asks for a ""small"" - serve a tall (that's a 12oz cup); if someone asks for ""medium"" serve a tall. Whatever they ask for, serve a tall. The only way you can get a short (8oz) size is to specifically ask for a ""short"" - whether cappuchino, mocha, latte, whatever. Sometimes the staff will deny there is any such size, but that's because they are stupid. Usually there is no hassle. Sometimes they will claim that they don't have the right size cups - in which case point them over to the children's milk size cups (which is the only place an 8oz appears on a standard Starbucks menu) and say: ""That one"".

I don't do it to be a pain in the butt - I just don't want to drink so much liquid. And it's mildly (very mildly) subversive.

What I see is the left and the right in America are pulling us steadily away from libertarianism.

Through both the social programs and political correctness of the left, and the crack down on personal freedoms of the right (""War on Drugs""), the distinction mentioned in the 2nd paragraph of the article, between the ruling and the ruled, has been put in place.

Nearly half the country thinks we are reliant on the government economically and most of the other half thinks we are reliant on it for moral guidance.  In both cases, few seem to be aware the important issue is reliance on a big brother that has been accepted by nearly all.

1. You want to use AOLServer instead of Apache. (Ummm, ok)

2. You should use Oracle. (Well, it seems Postgres has been a viable option for a while now)

I've seen them. They're not any better.
"One of the major problems with Penn and Teller's show is that they're more interested in making fun of the other side than actually understanding it. PETA doesn't even get a chance to explain their position before it's held up for ridicule. Even so, it's clear they have a rather serious one -- where's the moral difference between hurting people and hurting animals?

Penn and Teller argue it's OK to hurt animals if it helps us. For example, they say we need to test on animals so we can get better medicine. In reality, [PETA is not in favor](http://www.peta.org/factsheet/files/FactsheetDisplay.asp?ID=87) of banning medical testing -- they merely suggest that try to use new non-animal technology (like computer simulations and human culture testing) whenever possible and try to ""reduce the number of animals used and to minimize pain and distress"" when it's not.

Of course, that's a position that requires thinking a little bit to discuss. It's much more fun to call people Nazis."

But it turns out to be almost true. A scripting language is better than Java because a scripting langauge doesn't have to be compiled. A scripting language can be better than Lisp because string manipulation is simpler. ""

"This is just... Old. The Haskell community already knows this and has discussed it for several years. To counter just  of his points:
haskell.org SHOULDN'T promote a specific ""distribution"". Haskell is a standardized language that is implemented by several compilers/interpreters. Ruby, Python and Perl (his examples) are languages with a canonical implementation that more or less IS the language. Haskell 98 has several implementations with different uses and goals. All (or the most relevant to a newcomer any way) are presented on the homepage, along with what they are good at. A potential user has to make a choice, and if he looks at a tutorial they will likely recommend one."
"This is recycled news from about 5 years ago (or more).  But, it's a huge problem.  It's not just with electronic parts, but also US companies going into third world countries and setting up plants that pollute like that wouldn't be able to here.  The fact is, most third world countries would rather have a polluting US company than no US company at all.  The US should hold their companies to the standards that exist here, not elsewhere."
"... and where, despite it all, fewer people attend university than in the US (not well-known, but it's true)."
"I'm going to do a bold statement: Haskell is way too low level!

More precisely, my claims are that:
- a language is low level when it makes certain things more difficult to express than necessary;
- the casual [contrieved] recipes to circumvent this inexpressivness are called design patterns;
- therefore, omnipresence of design patterns in a language structure is a sign that this language is low level;
- as soon as you want to do I/Os, or anything vaguely stateful, in Haskell, you need beginner-unfriendly monads, which definitely are a design pattern, and a difficult to understand one;
--&gt; Haskell is too low level in contexts where you want to do something stateful. And a typical example of something stateful is: the real world.

Don't misread me, I love Haskell when used at its intended purpose: modelize highly logical/algorithmical stuff in a perfectly clean way. Only, that's a very narrow niche, most of what we actually do is unnecessarily complex to express that way. The same way you could do system programming in Prolog, but shouldn't."

"&gt;the fact that Perl, Python and Ruby have become popular while Haskell has stayed a marginal language is a failure of the Haskell community

It sounds like the author is faulting the Haskell community for ""not trying hard enough"" or something.  But it seems to me that the reason Haskell is unpopular is that it just isn't the kind of language that's fated to be popular right now.  (disclosure: I'm a Lisp guy, so I'm only partly qualified for this)

But I think that at least part of the reason for Haskell and Lisp's unpopularity is that they don't go out of their way to provide stuff that the so-called ""average programmer"" takes for granted -- like easy I/O and infix notation.  Haskell's and Lisp's respective communities have their reasons, which are perfectly legitimate, but they (at least, a lot of Lispers and the author of this post) haven't come to terms with the fact that if 'unconventional' or 'revolutionary' or 'unique'  are part of what your language *is*, it's not likely to be embraced by the mainstream quickly.  Changing people's minds takes time, and ""trying harder"" to make that happen is like trying harder to strike a match on a wet cake of soap.


Of course, none of this is meant to suggest that standardizing on a single distribution and whatnot aren't a good idea -- that would make Lisp a lot nicer too."

"Interesting read on the whole, but one point caught my eye -- Bonded child labourers in India.  I know quite a few people in the diamond cutting and polishing industry in India, and I've visited many such factories.  I've *never* seen a child (or a woman) working in these places.  The people who work there are highly skilled and earn a decent wage.

The article references a report on bonded child labour in India, which is a sad truth, but not in this particular industry.  The report actually refers to ""American Diamonds""(cubic zirconium) and not real diamonds."

"I suppose in certain really extreme cases you could use eval, but that would be... for really extreme cases.

There are various tools in Javascript for doing things that might call for macros in Lisp. AFAIK, where Lisp macros are used, they are not usually *essential*, just a way to cut down complexity and redundancy, and that's what I'm targetting here. I would have to see an example to try to create a real equivalent.

Javascript has object literals and a builtin for...in operation, which are the equivalent of a dictionary or association list elsewhere. I use a simple function for creating HTML (through the W3C DOM interface) that takes an object with (some of) the properties 'tag', 'attributes', 'children', etc. and creates  DOM nodes based on it. The resulting code is about 5% of the size and complexity of equivalent code that uses the DOM functions directly. (For this reason, I object heavily to modifying the object prototype object, since each added function will show up in a for..in operation.)

Another tool is doing wacky things with object prototypes and binding functions to objects. Setting aside the OO vs. functional debate, this is very handy at times. 

Also, in any function, the arguments are available as the array 'arguments', which can be used creatively, though not always constructively.

I *would* like to see a Lisp-like system where you can make macros by messing with the parse tree, but even that would not be nearly as useful as Lips macros. You could roll your own macro system by writing some text manipulation functions, loading Javascripts in as strings, processing them, and then loading them into the runtime with eval."

At the same time, does that make them wrong? They are possibly on to a solution for Africa's problems; the creation of infrastructure.

The apparent problem with Western aide to Africa was not that there wasnt enough, but that it does nothing. So here we have Chinese coming in and doing things, and doing them fast. I've been to China, and they work FAST. 

So now we have Chinese violating all kinds of moral principles, but in doing so they are accomplishing what the moral West cant.

It seems to me that we (Westerners) havn't gotten over cultural imperialism. We have to have things done our way, and because our way is the right way, it will produce the right results. It is becoming increasingly clear that this is not really the case, especially in Africa.

"I'm just wondering what Reddit needs to do to get noticed.

I guess it might just take time. But the comment system on Reddit is excellent - for one it has threaded discussions and does them very well, the formatting tools are very easy to use, and I love how voting a comment up or down is no different than voting a link up and down. That just makes sense, and its intuitive.

I also think that Reddit's system of just having a descriptive title instead of a title and a description is very wise. You can see many more stories. If you see a title that looks interesting, you actually look at the link. On Digg most of the time the title is worthless and all the thought it put into the description, or vice versa. Its just redundant. And then on Digg you have the problem of people only reading the description and digging it based on that.

And Reddit is just clean. I wish I had come up with the layout myself. Its just very simple and it gets things done. For that I think spez and kn0thing are genius (well, the whole site is genius), but Reddit really does have that same simplicity that made Google the bomb.

Also...its got the mascot. That's all I need to say about him. 

Right now it just seems like you got Digg and Slashdot slugging it out and Reddit is kind of the odd man out that no one really notices. But maybe that is a good thing, because right now the community is very good.

You, for example, enjahova, I've already spoken with you in several link discussions, and though we disagreed on a few things, I think it was done respectfully. With the massive amount of people who use both Digg and Slashdot, its much harder to recognize people, and you don't get the same respect while discussing.

One of the few things that irks me about Reddit is how some things are voted down just because of a mindset someone has. A link or a comment can be constructive and well-though out and can even be right, but just because people don't agree with that viewpoint they vote it down. That doesn't seem to be much of a problem right now (I have noticed it a few times), but it might become a bigger problem as the site grows."

"I've always been intrigued by the idea of JavaScript being used server-side. Its a good language and since it is so common client-side, it would only make sense to use it server side.

[deleted]
"I agree on the whole with your post. And yeah, I have noticed that we have had previous discussions. It is really what I enjoy most, the news may be interesting, but its more interesting to get lots of peoples perspectives on it.

As far voting on comments and links goes, I think the system will take care of itself. Barring organized attempts at trolling I think that everyone can vote encourages better discussion. If you just post something on a whim, you will be more likely to be voted down in an instant. If you post with respect and merrit, you will probably get voted up. The  people quick to vote up/down on mood should balance each other out.

I guess that leaves an interesting problem that I wonder if spez and kn0thing have considered (I'm sure they have). What about automated abuses? Can 1000 accounts be registered to vote a link up or a comment up? I'm sure right now that would be noticeable, but if you had nearly a million user count like slashdot, what would stop it? 

I guess these are the more interesting problems the creators are working on as the site expands, now that they gave us comments :)"

This is something that happened on Digg very recently. A single guy would register a few new accounts each day and use those accounts to promote/demote stories.

He then took it a step further and created many accounts and started spamming the comment system at Digg to prove a point. Every single story on the frontpage had over 500 comments via his automated bot.

"I think one of the main flaws of SlashDot has been the scope of the site.  The title of Slashdot says it best 'news for nerds, stuff that matters', but a lot of news that does matter doesn't get covered.  I enjoy Slashdot, but at times it is too technical and irrelevant for my taste.  This is where I think Reddit has it covered -- there is an adaquate cross-section to cover numerous tastes, from computers, programming to recent news and events.  It makes the task of parsing through SlashDot unnecessary when I can just go to Reddit."
"Hmmm interesting prediction. And yes /. will be a long time a-dying. But he's really only came up with 2 points: /. has dictator editors and they are getting older. 

Is the writer perhaps forgetting that the fan base is also aging *with* the editors? I mean, if /. manages to maintain its appeal on visitors and keep them, the editors aging isn't an issue is it? 

however if all /. is is gimmicky cool things of the moment included by editors, then yeah the gap will kill it. Sites like sparknotes come to mind.

"I hear you, but that's why I like slashdot. When things are specialized and a wide variety of such specialization exists, things are good (think nature). 

Reddit is cool and hot for the most interesting and sometimes relavent news, but as reddit's fanbase grows, i can't expect to see cool things particular to my programming/gaming/nerdy tastes all the time anymore. 

There are plenty of sources for new events (google news for example) but fewer specialized filters (such as this one), and for that reason /. is precious to nerds. at least for now."

"While your points make sense, I think the technology, implementation and cleanness promote a better community. 

First of all take digg, their stories are of interest to most people from slashdot, but their comment system is trash and allows for the crap that people post on it.

Then take reddit, I think right now it is small and the comment system is good enough. I do agree that a moderation system with filtering will probably be needed. Who knows, maybe these guys will come up with a new way to do forums?

I think the point is that the technology and implementation allowed for the community of slashdot to flurish, and people like me who come late to the scene appreciate just reading +5 comments that give me insight into things I couldn't get just from the articles.

My visiting to reddit went up a huge amount per day when they added comments, and it can still take away some forum real estate from slashdot if it fosters this community. This means that they will have to improve on this system more though..."

"i don't necessarily disagree with you, but a place like myspace can't strictly be considered a product; it's a community too.  thus in some ways, telling someone to change sites is akin to telling someone to leave their city or country. places like world of warcraft now have currencies translatable to real world dollars.

"U is a combinator, a function that takes a function and returns another function.
f is a function that takes a number or function and returns a number or calls the function.
n is a number

So U applies its argument to itself.  This means it makes a recursive function of its argument.  This means, in turn, that its argument must be a function capable of taking a functional argument.  Note that f fills this description.  So you can write a nonrecursive function (note that fact-nr is not recursive.), and then pass that nonrecursive function to U, which will make it a traditional recursive factorial, just like we have all written the first time we try out a  new lisp.

But why do all this?  If this were all there is to combinators, no one would use them.  But combinators can be used to fundamentally change the way function calls work in your language.  For instance, memoization can be an interesting technique-you can memorize the value of a function call, and then just return that when you get the same call again.  If your language supports combinators, you can hack in memoization yourself.  This is very cool.  I will try to write an essay about this, in my copious spare time.

"See if your school has something like an Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP). These seem to be relatively common, and typically provide something on the order of $1,500 to $2,000 for work on research projects under a faculty member. Not much money, but it is a start. This can be supplemented by additional grant money if it can be found (a well connected faculty member can help).

It might be possible for your department to create a short term job position for you if it has the funds available. This is a big 'if' and depends on a lot of factors ('extra' department cash, compliant faculty member, compelling project).

For student projects, it will be easier to find funding if you are working on something that qualifies as a research problem. Try to show potential funders that your idea is worth sinking a couple grand into. If you're thinking of some kind of message board 'Web 2.0' buzzword crap, you will have problems. Not that this junk isn't interesting but: much has already been done by people with more resources and experience, it's not really that innovative from a CS perspective (ooh, 'tagging'), and as a result the educational advantages would be slim.

I've focused on academic funding sources since much of the commercial world has problems understanding OSS. Since OSS scares many of the 'intellectual property' trolls, they will not be too inclined to risk cash for what they perceive as no return.

In any case, it would be helpful to develop a working relationship with a faculty member with related interests. This will bring you drastically more benefit than trying to whore yourself out to business. Working with faculty can also make for references when it is time to whore yourself out to business, or graduate shcools...

Summary:
* Define your project as a **research** problem.
* Find a faculty mentor.

Hope this helps."

"Aaron,
If PETA is ok with medical testing to save humans, why did they send that dude to tell high school kids that animal testing is 'unscientific'? Ok, if it was taken out of contest, fine (prove it). Anyways, giving money to an arsonist of medical labs says much more than some PETA FAQ (bullshit).

"I think maybe there are two levels of belief to be dealt with there are beliefs about facts, and metabeliefs about how you come to your beliefs about facts.

The only *belief* that I would say I have is a metabelief in the correctness of the scientific method for deciding what is fact. And in that context (most) religious people have two metabeliefs, one saying that the scientific method is *one* way of obtaining facts, and another saying that the bible (ku'ran/talmud etc) is also a source for facts, along with historical and modern interpretaions of their specific religious tradition.

I would claim that religous people are delusional because I think that the *facts* they believe are not true facts, but that is not a philisophicaly sound position because it comes down to the fact that I don't agree with one of their metabeliefs, which is subjective.

However, if we are to demand simplicity then holding two metabeliefs when one suffices is clearly excessive. So then we're left with atheists who's only metabelief is in the scientific method and fundamentalists who's only belief is in the religious tradition of their choice. I'm not sure how many fundamentalists there are who truly reject all knowledge obtained from the scientific method, but I hope they don't drive cars."

"Reading below, believers in a God are called delusional, irrirational, blind etc.  Why is it that non-believers get so upset because someone doesn't buy the theory that our complex being was created by accident?   I'm not convinced that we were created by accident and the ancient theories of evolution don't explain how we were created.  Science blows all kinds of holes in the theory that we evolved from non living material.  That said, I think evolution and creationism are not mutually exclusive.  No doubt, species have evolved over time to get stronger, however, evolution doesn't provide enough evidence to support our creation."

"There are many reasons we get upset, so I'll just present one of them.

You don't accept the idea that living matter came about from inorganic materials, but instead believe that some intelligent being somehow caused it to happen. Presumably you justify this belief by saying that science hasn't adequately explained how that particular event occurred, which is true. But then how do you choose which of the hugely numerous intelligent beings have been hypothesised by man to explain current gaps in his scientific knowledge? Why the christian god over the muslim god? Why buddha over fsm? There is no possible rational reason."

"You are mixing arguments.  Debating which secular religion is ""better"" is a different argument.  My point is that people can believe that  science does not support the theory that we were spontaneously created from inorganic material and still be rational human beings.  For example, sub cellular protien based machines exist that are so simple they cannot be evolved to.  There is no fossil evidence to suggest that intra-species evolution happened.  It is also mentioned that people seek a belief in a higher being because it is ""comfortable"". I would argue that it is more ""comfortable"" to believe that we  explain everything away."

that is rather telling, don't you think? the origin of species is not a religious issue to me, or to most everyone on my side of the ""debate"". (Dawkins may beg to differ; i am not as vocal an atheist as he.) to us, it's a matter of facts and the best possible way to explain those facts in the light of science. it's not about metaphysics or faith, it's about what the world is really like and how it got to be that way, based on what we actually _know_ about it.

On the one hand, the CotSM belief is connected to or derived from a whole set of other beliefs, such as
* The universe and we ourselves actually exist
* Our senses can be trusted and correspond in a significant way to the reality of the universe (we are not ""brains in a vat"" or ""copper-tops"")
* Information which is not scientifically demonstrable is not a ""fact"" (e.g., my wife loves me, Abraham Lincoln existed)

On the other hand, philosophers and historians of science have cast a lot of doubt upon the self-sufficiency of the scientific method, in the sense that it appears that scientists in fact do not use the scientific method as classically defined in the Baconian sense nearly as rigorously as lay-persons, or indeed scientists themselves, believe.

"Your link is pretty funny, particularly the way they twist and contort in order to try to turn a paper that's yet another huge verification of evolution into the opposite.  Off the front page: 

&gt;This new study identifies various noncoding or junk DNA sequences in the human genome that are conserved when compared to the corresponding regions in the genomes of a wide range of vertebrates.

""Conserved"" of course meaning conserved over evolution.  Now perhaps the authors of reason.org mean ""conserved"" in that the sense that the designer gave different species some similar stretches of DNA, except with minor changes that make it only appear to look like it was a product of evolution, rather than design. (Isn't that designer a tricky fellow?)

They then go on to imply that if there are a few new annotations in the 99% of DNA that appears to be non-functional, then &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; of it must be important, and not look like the huge mess of imperfection and non-design that it looks like. Ridiculous. Biologists have always known that there are likely functional elements, and for that very reason most avoid the term ""junk DNA"" as its used in that paper summary.

No sir, there is **no** way that ""people can believe that science does not support the theory that we were spontaneously created from inorganic material and still be rational human beings,"" as you said, unless they are simultaneously seriously misinformed.  And misinformation is the way that creationism persists; its all a load of dishonest tripe.

One more thing, you use the word ""spontaneous,"" which isn't quite the way that any biologist would describe evolution, which is very gradual, and which is random only in half: the mutation, or generation of minor variations.  The selection half is quite non-random, and which eventually selects the variations that provide the slightest of advantages.  

However, do you see that the standard creationist description of the creation of man precisely what you deride?  I.e. humans were spontaneously here on earth, created from inorganic matter."

The thing no one talks about is that religious belief has a social function and it is probably a by-product of evolution.  I think it evolved because groups with cooperative centers and competitive edges have an advantages over groups that don't.

I2P instead is something of a mixnet. Its main use is to provide sender and receiver anonymity.

"Mr. Dawkins is an avid atheist and is anti-religion.  What a waste of Reddit link space.

However, I modded this one up, just so that everybody can see how far off the deep end this man has stepped.  His elitism is without bounds, and it obvious why he has no problems looking down his nose at the 85+% world population who retain religious beliefs.

It's easy to reject religion and any sort of belief in a higher power when the world so obviously revolves around Mr. Dawkins's intellect.

At least he has a sense of humor about it?:

&gt; And what if, by some mischance, he were to find there is a God when he dies? He looks at me as if I were mad. ""The question is so preposterous that I can hardly grace it with a hypothetical answer,"" he says finally. ""But, to quote Bertrand Russell, I suspect I would say, 'There's not enough evidence, God'.""

"The basis for Christianity is not belief that the Bible is as an inerrant source of truth. The basis for intelligent Christian thought is the belief in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus, as recorded in the gospels, which form a historical (rather than mystical) basis. I do not appreciate those who represent Christianity as an arbitrary blind belief, either by those who believe it or those who do not. (The Answers In Genesis organization comes to mind. I've attended part of one of their mind-numbing weekend programs.)

Second, it is correct that those who promote scientific discovery should do so at the expense of certain untenable ideas within religious systems. It is not necessary to dismiss or contradict the progress of science in order to have some belief in the supernatural; neither is it necessary to ridicule all religion in order to promote science. I think those who do should be told to stick to science and avoid public discourse. Science, like religion, should expose itself by confidence in facts, not through spectacular displays of irrelevant criticism.

Third, there is misunderstanding behind the atheistic view of the origin of life, which is that science has completely explained the origin of life. This is not true. Scientists have yet to discover mechanisms for the appearance of life that are satisfactory science, rather than speculation. There are a variety of unanswered scientific questions regarding the origins of the universe and life, as there have always been in the history of modern science."
"So, to sum it up:

Paragraph 1: I believe in Christ because I believe in Christ.

"There is a difference between saying ""we don't know how things got started"" vs ""It was a designer (singular), and He was like this..."". One is honest.

You don't buy that our complex being didn't need a creator when something like God's complex being doesn't need one?

Equating the products of evolution with accidents is about as honest as claiming stalagmites come about by accident.

Science doesn't blow any kind of holes in the theory that the first self-reproducing entity came about from non-living material. All science says on the matter is ""we don't know how yet"" (which actually has nothing to do with the theory of evolution: abiogenisis, like the origin of the universe is just baggage Christians assumptively saddle on evolution). Saying science blows holes in abiogenisis is like saying science blows all kinds of holes in the idea of a fusion generator. We don't know [yet].

As for evolution doesn't provide enough evidence, the cockamamy version you've picked up by osmosis might not provide enough evidence, but if you actually go and learn about it you'll find a theory that's watertight and pretty much irrefutable, but also demonstrable. The ""holes in evolution"" you keep hearing about aren't in evolution at all, they are abiogenisis and the origin of the universe - they are gaps in the theory of a godless universe, not gaps in the theory of evolution."

Were this an article on Dawkins's specialty, biology, then I would have no problem with it.  His so-called scholarship on biology has been dealt with by scholars of his caliber or higher.

But I take issue with the claim that the contempt of Dawkins for those ""with religion"" is based on a cool analysis of his academic findings and observations.  Even the most entrenched atheists won't make public comments like his.

Even in his academic specialty, he finds spectacular ways to treat the opposition:

""It is absolutely safe to say that if you meet someone who claims not to believe in evolution, that person is ignorant, stupid or insane (or wicked, but I'd rather not consider that)."""

Whenever someone who is uncomfortable with technology reads or hears about Alan Turing's original proposed test for artificial intelligence for the first time, they inevitably make an objection. Just as inevitably, that objection was covered in Turing's original paper on the subject. No popular media has ever provided me anything new about artificial intelligence.

Similarly, religious twits will be upset and confused by reality until the heat death of the universe. So I read about the latest tireless efforts by Richard Dawkins to explain concepts that were well understood 100 years ago, and I'm irritated. Irritated silly.

i don't know about you, but i see reporting and posts about religion _a lot_ more often than i do pieces about atheism. both online and in ""traditional"" media. maybe i'm looking in the wrong places, but i could easily dig up half a dozen interviews with various catholic strange-hat wearers talking about their (to me, repulsive) opinions on policy and society for each piece like this one i spot, and that's even *after* i count the atheist blogs i read.

really, the anti-religion crowd is nowhere near as loud and obnoxious as the anti-atheism wingnut brigade (cf. pat robertson), and the atheists tend to be more erudite when they *do* start jousting. i see no reason why they should be any more strongly criticized than their counterparts... who, IMO, don't catch nearly enough criticism for *their* jousting.

funny, i see a lack of balance in these matters going exactly the opposite way. i tend to agree with Dawkins that religion gets let off much more easily than any other comparable philosophical point of view, including atheism.

"I can think of two useful beliefs I espouse that contradict yours.

I believe that the scientific method can be used to decide a great many facts. I'm of the opinion that there are a class of real facts for which the scientific method is inadequate. My hope is that in the future the line between the two will become clear enough that the theologians can reclaim what is theirs and possibly look after this body of knowledge with some rigor.

I also believe that all people believe themselves to be acting in good faith, doing the right thing nearly all the time. As much as Dawkins' typical atheistic tone makes my blood boil, I can put myself in his position and appreciate where he is coming from.

I think he's getting an unearned easy pass right now though. It's easy to point accusing fingers at ""religion"" right now and get modded up hundreds of points. It's a fact that Gen X and Gen Y demographic groups tend to be suspicious of institutions. Cast religion as evil instutution and Dawkins' can just ""ride the wave"" and huge number of viewers will natually assume he is right.

Just as there are stand out atrocities to tar the name of religion, there are stand out atrocities committed by governments devoid of supposed religious influence. Just as there are stand out examples of human care and kindness due to religion, maybe you can find me some examples those brought about by communisim.

In the long run, I expect that ""religion"" as Dawkins accuses of being the root of all evil, will be found to be either a red herring, or statistially a deterrent to evil. He doesn't seem willing to consider that right now, wrapped up in an emotional response to a lot of anecdotes.

"I think the syntax argument is pretty much crap. Why is it a good thing that XML treats any non-angle bracket/ampersand as regular text? Beyond that it does use standard human characters as markup, in using the equals sign to assign data to an attribute and quotation marks to encapsulate that data.

The redundancy argument also is a problem as generally BOTH styles will require the assistance of a program to consistently detect the problem while writing. I will agree that explicit closing tags make error checking easier, but that could be added to s-expressions as well. The documentation for lisp was written in latex as that was the most portable method of conveying it that people (who did not already have lisp) had.

The only decent argument in this whole article is the one he makes at the end. XML helped create a lot of tools for its own manipulation, and in the end learning those tools is probably easier than learning lisp. The reason that it is better for the problem domain is that individual concepts are easier to learn than all of lisp and the tools to work with it have already been made and are widely in use."

"with due respect, sir, the word is _atheist_. there were atheists around, spelling the word in that fashion, long before Darwin and Wallace, and we surely would still be around if neither of them had ever lived. evolution is no cornerstone of atheistic philosophy, no matter what Dawkins may think.

and the thing about talkorigins is not their objectivity (though i note they link to rather more of their opponents than bother linking back to them...), but rather that they _list peer-reviewed references_ and explain _why_ the mainstream scientific point of view -- which they unashamedly present -- is mainstream and considered credible. they back up their positions with evidence and logic, not faith alone; it is really not a matter of belief in the religious sense at all.

it makes as much sense to say you ""believe"" in evolution as to say you ""believe"" in Newton's theory of gravity. both are scientific theories that explain the observed facts and make predictions we can test, which have stood up to testing very well for a very long time. both of them could be disproven, if sufficiently weighty facts were found that didn't fit into their explanations and predictions (and Newton's theory has been, to an extent, by Einstein), but by and large that just hasn't happened, despite centuries of testing.

neither of them explain everything -- in fact, both of them leave quite a bit unexplained -- but each of them explain a lot of things that no competing, rival theory gets close to settling. religion simply doesn't play in this league at all; i think it would be fair to say that this isn't what religion is _for_.

I'm only a Christian because I decided I wasn't just going to believe in feelings, but if I was to have faith it would be a rational one. I did plenty of study on the historics of Christianity and other related fields, and I think there is plenty of evidence to support it.

Now sure, I can't explain how everything happened or works, but no one can. That's part of the fun of living."
"Awesome!

Let's launch a crusade against Christ teaching, ""Love your neighbor as yourself"".

That'll get em good!

The problem with people like Dawkins is they refuse to realize that there is a difference between people who call themselves Christians but act completely contrary to the label they give themselves, and true Christians who actually follow what Christ taught.

Dawkins decides that because some people used God's name to do evil things, God himself (speaking figuratively here), is evil. That's just a horrible way to look at things.

I'm not going to sit here and pick and choose a single atheist who killed someone and say, ""Hey, atheists are all evil!"", so why should Dawkins do the same?

"I don't think a solid statistical objection to the evolution of man is likely, let me explain...

There are two seperate concepts being mixed up here, that evolution happened, and how evolution works. 
That evolution happened is fairly well established. As for how it happens, we've figured out many mechanisms responsible (genetic drift, natural selection, sexual selection, etc) and these may fully explain the phenomena. However if it could be shown that there was a solid statistical problem with the timeframe of the evolution of higher life forms, then that would be evidence of more mechanisms at work yet to be uncovered. Sure, one of the extra mechanisms could be an interventionist god, but jumping to this conclusion immediately would be premature given how much has been discovered since Darwin's time (thanks to a growning understanding of genetics). It wouldn't be evidence against evolution (in the sense that Jurassic rabbit fossiles would be).

However you'll have to be a bit more specific because the only statistical arguments I've encountered have
been dishonest strawman constructions and sophestry, I imagine genuine research into the area (which I'm sure exists) is interesting. 

(Tho the discovery of genes that control genes may break some assumptions in older statistical research)"
"One of the things that bugs me about javascript is that the for ... in syntax applies to objects but not to arrays, for which you still need to use the tired for(i=0;i&lt;array.length;i++) {}... unless there's a better way?

Otherwise, Javascript is strikingly similar to Lua; both are good general-purpose languages and they both have ""table constructors"" (the {...} operator in both languages, except Javascript confusingly also uses {} for code blocks).  I can't think of any other language that has this feature, at least as something you can do at any point in the code.

"Because I think the actions make the man.

And in the case of Muhammad, you see him spreading his religion by the sword, become fantastically wealthy, and marry many many women.

He gained much by his exploits. He also seems very double-minded. There is a story in the Hadith about how Muhammad was tricked by Satan and had to have someone else call him out on it and then he made the right ruling. If Muhammad was tricked by Satan once, how do you know he wasn't tricked the entire time?

Joeseph Smith was even worse. This is a man who destroyed a printing press because they said negative things about him. This is a man who said that the American government would be destroyed by the wrath of God (still standing, btw). This is a man who married many many women, including women that already were married. He, like Muhammad, became extremely wealthy.

Joseph Smith had ""prophecy"" after ""prophecy"" that ended up being completely false. Several of the original men who swore that they saw the golden tablets the Book of Mormon was translated on later ended up recanting their story. 

Not only that, but the Book of Mormon has absolutely no historical or archaelogical backing. This is not the case at all with the Bible.

Actually, the stories of Muhammad and Joseph Smith are eerily similar when you do some study on the two.

But the I look at Christ's actions. He never gained anything by what he preached. He didn't become weathly. He didn't marry many women. He didn't try to overthrow the government or start wars. He, much like the Bible says, ""was led like a lamb to the slaughter"".

I also see many OT prophecies concerning Christ that are very specific and fit his character exactly. For example, 

""And I will pour out on the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem a spirit [a] of grace and supplication. They will look on [b] me, the one they have pierced, and they will mourn for him..."" - Zechariah 12:9-11

Keep in mind, this is written at least 400 years before Christ, and is written by a Jew in a society that was so scared of idolatry that they wouldn't even say his name, much less ascribe to him any kind of a physical form. Yet this piercing of God very much fits the image of Christ.

Anyway, to make a long story short, Christ practiced what he preached, ""To love the Lord your God with all your heart and to love your neigbhor as yourself"". He didn't have anything to gain. Infact, he gave everything for his message. Muhammad and JS gained many worldy pleasures for what they did.

I also think that something that isolates Christianity from other religions is it is the only religion that teaches salvation by faith as opposed to salvation by works. Whether it be Mormonism or Buddhism, every other religion except Christianity teaches that to reach God or heaven or Nirvana you must be a good person. You must do good things. Christianity teaches that no number of good deeds will get you into heaven, only through faith in Jesus Christ will you get into heaven. Only through putting your trust in him.

That is the entirety of the Gospel and what sets it apart from the messages of other religions."

I would also argue that the innovation in web services has come from *industry* and not from research labs. Thus, that also proves his point.

&gt; Paragraph 2: 'Science should not talk of religion because religion belongs to another realm.' Sorry, the scientific method is not that easily escaped.

No, he's very right. Science cannot reach outside of time and space, and if God does exist, he exists in some realm outside of time and space. Currently science doesn't have any influence in those areas.

"Islam:  No.

Islam considers Jesus to be of rank no higher than a prophet when there is the slight problem of centuries of Christian scholars, evidence, and Catholic institutions in advance of Mohammed objecting to the contrary.

Additionally, there is rarely a doctrinal center to Islamic belief.  Frequently you will find recent Islamic scholars effectively reversing early fundamental Islamic philosophical belief when it becomes glaringly deficient.  Predestination immediately comes to mind.

Joseph Smith:  No.

The polygamy issue alone is probably enough to place the entire faith in doubt.  Joseph Smith claimed polygamy to be a directive from God, and yet he also embraced Jesus and Christian scripture, who condemned such notions.

True, Mormonism has publicly, officially reversed their doctrine on polygamy, but like Mohammed &amp; Islam, it complete ly discredits a religion when the modern doctrinal observations contradict earlier beliefs of the same religion."

"The reason its a pile on of one-sided debates is that it is objective!  The science all points in that direction!

There's more productive debate about evolution from evolutionary biologists, the evolution- development camp, and ecology than from the past 100 years of creationist work."
"I just want to correct that according to many books about him, Mohammed was not a rich man and he was even a very poor person. He finished all his first wife's money for telling his religion. He married to 9 women-most of them were old and widow (why not young and beautiful girls?). He married them because he had to teach his religion to women by using his wifes. Many of his teachings and principals (called sunnah) was firstly learnt and spreaded by this women. 
Also if he says that satan tried to trick him once, does not it show that he was aware of what comes from satan and what comes from the God and God helps him? 
Also he always praised Christ and he did not say anthing bad about him. All his followers loved  and others as a prophet. So how can we think that he did all these for his benefits? He is poor, married to widows, fought and wounded to protect his country and his religion. I do not think that he made them just for his pleasure.

Arabians were the most cruel people of that time (they were even burying their doughters-because it was shame for them)and he taught these people moral values.

Also, regarding your last statement, the basis for rejecting religion isn't because of the cool things that Jesus said. Most of the atheists I know have a moral philosophy remarkably like Jesus's, as ""love your neighbor as yourself"" is a great basis to an ethical system.  What is objectionable, however, is all the religious and social claptrap that has built up in the past 2000 years religion that leads to wars, hatred, judging one's neighbor, and affronts to human dignity such as [God Hates Fags](http://www.godhatesfags.com).  Humans of course will do these things with or without religion, but armed with the arrogance of being right (e.g. ""I know that God wants me to do"") people do much worse things than they would otherwise. (Suicide Bombers?)One might expect that religion might make also make people do more good than they would otherwise, but in my personal experience (and this is of course just anecdoctal) those who are doing the greatest good in the world--working with the poor, disadvantaged, and the downtrodden, and in the process eschewing personal wealth and comfort--are uniformly not religious.  I'm guessing your personal experience is different, that the people you know that exude fundamental decency are religious.

In paragraph 1 you state:
""The basis for intelligent Christian thought is the belief in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus, as recorded in the gospels, which form a historical (rather than mystical) basis. I do not appreciate those who represent Christianity as an arbitrary blind belief, either by those who believe it or those who do not.""

More succinctly, _you_ state that Christianity is not a blind belief because _Christians_ _believe_ it is rooted in history. I hope it is clear that this is a patently absurd statement to make. The belief in the historical reality of the gospels is but a plaster on a wooden leg, a convenient but hollow excuse to make it acceptable to believe - but it is still a circular reasoning, because the historical reality of the gospels is far from being accepted in mainstream science.

"How about you look around I2P before you make such claims? You or anyone but a hand full of people will never work on this project anyway.

Id say the problem that freenet, the most notorious example,  had with this was caused by several factors:

1. Its performance was so terrible that only those doing the most elicit things bothered to stick around.
2. The size of these files, usually small pictures, was optimal for freenet. There just aren't that many 200k files out there these days.
3. There was a culture that celebrated the idea of being totally freed from all censorship. By human nature, this intrigued many people who then began, out of curiosity, to test the limits and see if such a thing is really possible.

I2P (by itself), on the other hand, can be very poor for one to many distribution of dangerous content over a long period of time. A simple attack would be incrementally DOS or otherwise interrupt known blocks of suspected ip addresses and watching for the server in question to go offline in I2P. This will be effectively solved by layering a DHT system, perhaps freenet, on top of a mixnet like I2P.. but I digress. 

All in all, I think the most advanced p2p networks have contributed very little to the spread of cp. I'm against it as much as the next guy, but this age old argument has been proving untrue. If your **really** interested in trying to stop cp how about you go after usenet? Good luck with that one..

"I was going to let this slide, but I don't want Python misrepresented to someone looking to use it.

1. GIL doesn't matter on unithread systems whatsoever (the vast majority of systems fall into this category). Therefore, since thread concurrency isn't used in most systems there must be another reason. What reason? Threads are a concurrency abstraction. No, let me modify that: A good concurrency abstraction. Especially when waiting for IO, threads are an elegant solution (granted not the only).

2. The GIL is not a feature of Python. Stackless, as I pointed out, doesn't even have the GIL. The GIL is an implementation feature. In other words, get a new VM without the GIL and you don't have to worry about it. Currently there are 3 major implementations of pyhton without the GIL: Stackless, IronPython and Jython. There's also one experimental implementation without the GIL: PyPy.

The gospels, viewed historically, indicate that Jesus went through the process of roman crucifixion, and was therefore not only merely dead, but really most sincerely dead.

"First, the brain *is* a neural network... it may not be exhaustively (or even accurately) described by the artificial neural nets constructed by scientists and engineers, but it is unequivocally a network of neurons.

The observation that scientists' metaphors for the mind/brain often reflect current technology is valid.  However, scientists know (or, are supposed to know) that their models/theories are wrong and/or incomplete... that's why the constant goal is to test the assumptions or predictions of those models and theories.  Pointing out that metaphors of mind follow trends does nothing substantive to invalidate those metaphors.  Some metaphors are revealed to be less appropriate than others through empirical work, but that just means that the metaphors and the related theories are being *appropriately* tested.  That's a scientist's job.

The work described in the article is more about cognition (the computations being performed) than the brain itself, anyway.  I think what Griffiths and Tenebaum really show is that peoples' mental models, learning, and decision making appear to make use of Bayesian computations (or structured mental representations that bear some likeness to bayesian networks).  This isn't terribly surprising: to the extent that conditional probabilities accurately describe the world and to the extent that one believes the mind is well-adapted to understand and reason about the world, there *should* be a link between the math and the cognition."

"First, whether or not (non)belief in god may have desireable or undesireable implications or outcomes is more or less irrelevent to god's existance or lack theirof.

Second, looks like you're also bringing in the god=absolute morality thing, which I have trouble with.

I see four possibilities:

God exists, and there is such a thing as absolute morality,

God exists, and there is no such thing as absolute morality,

God doesn't exist, and there is such a thing as absolute morality.

God doesn't exist, and there is no such thing as absolute morality.

You seem to claim that only the first and last options are possible.

ie, that morality is simply whatever god says to do. But then I could say ""what obligates me to do what god says?""

ie, you have to assume some sort of absolute morality anyways that implies a concept of doing what god says being a Good Thing(tm).

But then, it no longer seems unreasonable that lack of a god would directly imply lack of an absolute morality.

Now, whether or not an absolute morality exists is not what I'm arguing here, merely that the existance or not of one is not identical to the question of the existance or not of god."

Mohammed's claims were different:  Christ did not say the things you said he said, so your claims to truth are in error.

For Islam, the burden is upon Mohammed to explain how the phenomena of Christianity that progressed over the centuries and existed in his day was in complete error on so fundamental an issue.  There was an established body of Christian doctrine, Christian institutions, gospel fragements, copies of Christian scripture meticulously maintained, and writings of early church fathers which all apparently made this error.

"On the contrary, the free market IS the best way to ensure that water is shared as equally and effectively as possible.  In many places in africa, water is run by the government.  The result is that the rich (and politically influential) get water pipelines and cheap water, while the poor end up paying many times MORE to people who cart the water to more remote areas, since the government does not have the incentive to run pipelines there.

Africa is a mess of government run and ""privatized"" (meaning that the government grants a monopoly to a particular company and still doesn't stop messing around in the market) water services.  You'll hear people throwing around the word ""privatization"" when the actual situation is anything but a free market.  Places with truly free markets in water don't have shortages.

"""Bayesian"" is a very very vague term, and this article isn't talking about Bayesian networks (I prefer the more general term graphical models), or Bayesian spam filtering, but rather a mode of ""logic"" that people use in everyday thinking. Thus the better comparison would be not to neural nets, but to propositional logic, which I think we can agree doesn't happen very often in people unless they've had lots of training.  My favorite text on Bayesian reasoning is the [Jaynes book.](http://www.amazon.com/o/asin/0521592712).

Still, I'm less than convinced by the representation of the data in this article.  Secondly, the article isn't even published yet to allow anyone to review it.  Thirdly, I'm suspicious of any researcher that talks to the press before their data is published.  So in short, the Economist really shouldn't have published this, and should have waited.  Yet another example of atrocious science reporting."

"_So, my hearsay is that evidence about the life of Jesus is stronger by several orders than that for any other ancient event._

No, that is not the case. E.g. Julius Caesar, who lived until 44 BC, and for whose life we have a pretty complete picture from his own writings, as well as from contemporaries. Several orders more than for Jesus.

Like I have said before on another thread, Christ did not create the religion, he was created by it. I think the god-like events in Christ's life have been lifted and assembled from previously existing mythologies.

"I hate tab characters because if you use them you are contending that the width of the tab doesn't matter, and 95% of the time it actually does.  When I am given a file that uses tabs for indenting, 19 times out of 20 I can deduce what the tab width the author used was, since the file looks crappy with any other tab width.  The usual culprits are 1) inconsistent use of tabs vs spaces to indent, and 2) columns that line up somewhere else to the right of where the lines start (e.g., comments), but only line up correctly if the indentation is a particular amount."

Firstly, no _belief_ is needed to be convinced that there is no whispy dragon in the garage. We do not need belief to bridge a gap in our knowledge here - just our common-sense understanding of the world is enough. We go into that garage many times a week and never see a dragon, we know nobody has in fact ever seen one in the wild, let alone in his garage, etc. We have NO positive proof. But we do have an overwhelming amount of negative proof: it would run against all our other knowledge of the world to have a whispy dragon in the garage. Thus, I can safely and scientifically say that there is no dragon in the garage.

'Ah, but there might be one NOW!', you might say. There might be, but what are the odds? I would have to say that the odds are approximately equal to the existence of a bad-breadthed bogeyman under your bed. You made it up, it has no basis in reality.

So until you show me some whispy dragon excrement or a nice picture of it sleeping in the corner, I will 'believe' (I think 'be convinced of' is a better expression) in the non-existence of whispy dragons in the garage.

"here's the press release:

Following the success of our digital line-up over the last seven years, which has resulted in more than 95% of Nikonâs UK business being within the digital area, Nikon Corporation has made the decision to focus management resources on digital cameras in place of film cameras. This decision will allow Nikon to continue to develop products that match the demands of an increasingly competitive market place.


Despite this growing competition Nikon Corporation has continued to outperform the market, and has recently reported positive financial results which saw group net profit climb by 20% in the fiscal first half which ended in September. Group sales also increased by 9.8% to 342.85 billion yen in the same period. Sales of high end digital SLR cameras and the success of products like the D70s and D50 have helped contribute to these positive figures.


As the film camera market shrinks and the popularity of compact digital cameras increases, demand for products that offer advanced features and extra value is continuing to grow. High performance digital SLR cameras are performing well as users shift from film-based SLR cameras or upgrade from compact digital cameras to digital SLR cameras.


As a result of the new strategy Nikon will discontinue production of all lenses for large format cameras and enlarging lenses with sales of these products ceasing as soon as they run out of stock. This also applies to most of our film camera bodies, interchangeable manual focus lenses and related accessories. Although Nikon anticipates that the products will still be in retail distribution up to Summer 2006.


In recognition of Nikonâs commitment to professional photographers we will continue to manufacturer and sell the F6, our flagship film model, as well as a number of manual interchangeable lenses. Sales of the manual FM10 will also continue outside Europe.

"One of my phil professors had an interesting take on this argument.  A lot of us were atheists (or agnostics, i.e. closeted atheists), and most of us thought we had come by our (un)beliefs by 'abandoning our preconceptions' or some such.



So he said, ""Suppose that over the course of a few weeks this spring, groups of physicists working at different universities successfully prove that the universe was created by a group of superintelligent entities that the press has taken to calling 'The Big Bangers'.  Astronomical work to identify instances of their intervention in the movements of certain star clusters is proceeding rapidly, and some researchers have begun to speculate about the possibility of talking to them.  Now suppose that you've been out hiking on the Appalachian Trail for the last two months, so you learn about this all at once when you stop for gas on the drive home.  How does all this make you feel?""


The story illustrates a couple of points:
* ""Belief in God"" is not inherently unscientific.  It is unsupported by everything we know, but the existence of an agentive, purposeful creator of the universe hasn't been *disproven* either.
* As a corollary, there are some elements of faith in atheism, but you need a pretty far-fetched example to shake that faith.
* It's **not** correct to say that religion and science are about two different things (the truth-belief dichotomy), because people won't place their faith in something they know to be untrue.  Monotheists in our story would be in for an interesting ride.
* It **is** correct that knowledge can be put to use in different ways, and that most people are interested in scientific knowledge in only a very cursory way.  A devout Lutheran real-estate developer in Minnesota, for example, might find ways to reconcile the polytheistic revelation with his faith (""No God before me"" =&gt; existence of other Gods), and go on living the same way as before.  He'd be able to do this because his fundamental place in the world wouldn't have changed much.  A lapsed Hindu physicist, on the other hand, would have her professional *and* personal worlds turned upside down.  Besides the implications for physics, she might feel the need to make all kinds of changes to her life after thinking about what it all means, despite the fact that she already ""knows"", as a Hindu, that the Universe is basically ageless and is populated by many Gods   (my apologies to any Hindus out there if I've gotten this all wrong)."

"I asked the developer some questions via email, here they are along with his responses:

Q: You've kindly made Xtend available for download, but will it work on my Win2K SP4 box with .Net2?
A: I think so, I haven't tried so I can't be sure but it should work.

Q: Will it have a significant cost in terms of overall performance?
A: Not really, it is essentially just a database of URLS and links between URLS, i.e. it is quite simple under the hood.

Q: If I install it, will it destroy my current folder hierarchy?
A: No, it is very unobtrusive.

Q: I assume that files are still saved in a folder somewhere ""under the hood"" as it were. Will they still be accessible without using the Xtend interface? 
A: Yes you can get hold of all the files you create directly in XTend or Move to XTend as your repository is simply a folder with a lots of subfolders containing the actual files. If you are worried you can LINK your documents with XTend instead of moving them and they will stay in the same place as where you created them.

Q: Does Xtend replace Explorer completely or just the Search tool?
A: Ideally you use it instead of Explorer when working with documents, but it doesn't completely replace Explorer for things like working with System files.

Q: ...It's a shame this product was so ahead of it's time...perhaps if you open-sourced it and put it on Sourceforge, more people would use it and development could continue. 
A: Unfortunately the CODE is a bit spaghetti like, and I am not exactly proud of it: I had a junior programmer working for me and the time and got him to do most of the coding, so to be made open source it would need a fair amount of work first."

"I disagree with your Africa example. If the water market had been privatized there the only thing that would change is that the rich would propably be paying more for their water( which is a good thing), but it still would not be profitable to deliver water to the poor, because the cost of water transportation to a certain region increases exponentially to the the ammount of water transported, because there is not that much water in Africa, so it has to be imported from far away. This problem is neither solvable by governments nor by a free water market as long as the economy is so weak(which of course partly results from a lack of free market paired with corruption), which is sadly a bit of a catch-22."

Yes, it is, and more so: any belief is unscientific. Now, the word 'believe' is used in many subtly different way, and one could say I 'believe' in the existence of protons, even though I have never seen one. One could say I 'put my faith' in those who have repeatedly measured these protons. I hope you can see that this is not the belief I am railing against. We all need to make a map of the world in our head, and in that process we must make abstractions - 'the map is not the territory'. The belief I am railing against is the great leap of faith, the willingness to take fantasy for reality because it appeases some subconscious longing.

While I'm glad someone tried summarizing it, I really doubt anyone will gain a lot of benefit from reading that outline. The original fills page after page with examples. Examples illustrate why you should never criticize, always listen to people and keep your mouth shut when they are talking. From examples you realize that every moment you listen to that person, even if they are blathering on about nonsense, you are gaining thier trust.

People tend to retain far more from anecdotal examples than bullet points. Even if the bullet points are spot on accurate summaries, brains don't remember that stuff. They remember the stories behind them. Stories build bridges between the reality I live in, and those bullet points.

I read the book. After hundreds of pages of examples, I could see that getting people to act is an art I could master with practice. With this mastery comes the ability to accomplish incredible things.

The outlines while I'm sure they give a person a leg up, fall woefully short of the grand theme of understanding people. It's that theme that made the book the amazing piece of research and explanation that it was.

That said, I'd love to be wrong. Editorialists of the world, please read this. Read this and realize you can accomplish more by disposing of the venom. Maybe even read the book.

This is a philosophical argument, not scientific evidence *per se*. Note that to make this argument, one must also argue that the IPU is an ""unnecessary"" entity.

"There are several caveats to this paper. First, methane is a minor greenhouse gas compared with CO2. Second, the authors do not claim at all that the methane content of the atmosphere needs to be revised. They simply found that living plants produce methane, by cultivating plants under a bell jar and irradiating them to preclude the possibility of bacteria contaminating the measurement. The political aim here, if there is one, is rather to undermine the notion of planting trees to act as a carbon sink.

Finally, it is interesting that 'Levels of methane were ""very temperature sensitive,"" with concentrations approximately doubling with every 10 degrees centigrade rise in temperature in a range between 30 degrees centigrade and 70 degrees centigrade'. If that's the case, increased production of methane might be caused by global warming."

"Wrong. Methane is more potent than CO2 as a greenhouse gas. Look it up: for example, from just the first link on Google, I found http://members.aol.com/profchm/gina.html.

From that page (other sources agree with it):
*Methane is the second largest contributor to global warming. It is a very effective greenhouse gas, 20 to 60 times more potent than carbon dioxide over the next 100 years. Methane is a large contributor to global warming, second only to carbon dioxide. Its atmospheric concentration is 1.7 ppmv, much less than carbon dioxide; but each molecule of methane is twenty times more effective than each molecule of carbon dioxide at trapping infrared radiation (Mackenzie and Mackenzie, 1995). Its large contribution to global warming is due in part to its potency in trapping heat in the earth's atmosphere. It is 20 to 60 times more potent than carbon dioxide over the next 100 years. Emissions of methane have grown dramatically; methane emissions from human-related activities now represent about 70% of total emissions, as opposed to less than 10% some 200 years ago.*

Methane is not minor compared to CO2. It's highly relevant in terms of global warming, probably even more important than CO2 in the long run. Get your facts right before throwing out bullshit like ""political aims""."
"*What ""meddling"" has occurred in response to global warming? The Kyoto Protocol?*

Yes. Adamantly yes. The Kyoto Protocol meddles with the human economy - i.e., it makes every human being's life harder - in order to achieve absolutely nothing that is even remotely certain."

"Wow, did you read the same article I did? I read that ""what I've learned from failure"" one from a few days ago and thought it was a disjointed, rather vacuous read that was pumped up extensively by arbitrary and often out of place quotes. I ended it having gained NOTHING out of the exercise.

This one, on the other hand, doesn't seem intended to be a piece of grand wisdom, but rather questions the long-repeated claim of some of the web personalities that they only hire the top 1% or whatever. That does rub a lot of people the wrong way, and it's nice to see someone come out and call them on it. On the flip side I followed some of the links from this article that led to some fantastic advice that actually was very beneficial.

"These kinds of tools have been available to private detectives for years and years. And no, to be a ""private detective"", you don't need licenses or training. Heck, my dad posed as a ""private detective"" when he was in college to snoop on his frat brothers and gather salacious details of their lives for public humiliation at parties.

"&gt; This isn't about socialism vs capitalism. It's about superstition being taught as science, and it's about separation of church and state.

I'll preface my comment by saying that I don't necessarily think that ID should be taught in schools. However, the whole **separation of church and state** thing is so misused that its getting tiring.

""Separation of church and state"" originates from a letter that Thomas Jefferson wrote to a collection of Baptist ministers promising that the US government would never enact any kind of ruling that would restrict the free practice of religion in any way.

There is nothing Constitutionally or otherwise that says that Christianity or any other religion cannot be involved in the government in some way. Infact, democracy implies quite the opposite: rule by the people, and if the majority of people follow one religion, it follows that governmental decisions will likely be influenced by that religion.

This is not an issue of church and state. This is an issue of science and teaching science, and I personally have yet to see really strong science that supports creationism, although I have come across many interesting things in the past few years.

I personally don't think it matters. Whether evolution is true or not, I still think it is God who did the creating. I do not think that ID needs to be taught in school unless it is taught in a scientific manner. ID can be taught in the approach of, yes, there is evidence for evolution, but there is also strong evidence that the complexity of life and the ridiculous amount of ""coincidences"" make it highly improbably that this all happened by accident.

However, it shouldn't be a matter of popping out the Bible and saying, ""Okay, kids, this is what ID is"", because that isn't the point of school.

Anyway, I dread the comments that this whole debate will get, as it is both a political and a religious issue and if it were just one of the two, the comments would be heated enough...but combine both and all hell will break loose. Its probably where Carmack got his inspiration for Doom."

"*""...but there is also strong evidence that the complexity of life and the ridiculous amount of ""coincidences"" make it highly improbably that this all happened by accident.""*

No there isn't.  There is no serious doubt among scientists that evolution, driven by natural selection (which is anything but 'random' or 'accidental'), mutation, and genetic drift, is able to produce complex life.  This ""life is too complex"" argument was long ago dismissed and discredited, but keeps getting dredged up by creationists and others who are simply ignorant of the available evidence.  If you want to believe that God created the Universe and occasionally intervened in evolution to achieve a desired result (whether it be humans, mosquitoes, or bubonic plague), fine - science can neither prove or disprove such occasional meddling - but don't call it science.  ID is inherently unscientific (it isn't testable), and thus cannot truly be taught in a scientific manner.

I strongly recommend that you check out the talk.origins website, especially the FAQ's - http://www.talkorigins.org

*""There is nothing Constitutionally or otherwise that says that Christianity or any other religion cannot be involved in the government in some way.""*

Read the 1st Amendment again - ""**Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion**, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; ""

If the government is spending tax dollars to teach Christian fundamentalist dogma in public school science classrooms, then it's quite clear to me that the government is indeed respecting an establishment of religion."

A few years back I was reading a book about evolution and the explanation that was given as to how dinosaurs led to birds was that certain dinosaurs started jumping from tree to tree, and slowly their scales would become feathered from this. Eventually that led to the development of feathers. I'm sorry, but that is downright the most retarded thing I've ever heard in my life. No matter how much I take a lizard and feather his scales, its offspring aren't going to slowly develop feathers. That just doesn't happen. I don't know if it was just a bad explanation, but it doesn't take a biologist to realize that many explanations given for both evolution and creation are inherently flawed.

--- pp. 51-52:
âIf a particular amino acid sequence was selected by chance, how rare an event would this be?
âThis is an easy exercise in combinatorials.  Suppose the chain is about two hundred amino acids long; this is, if anything rather less than the average length of proteins of all types.  Since we have just twenty possibilities at each place, the number of possibilities is twenty multiplied by itself some two hundred times.  This is conveniently written 20200 and is approximately equal to 10260, that is, a one followed by 260 zeros.
âMoreover, we have only considered a polypeptide chain of rather modest length.  Had we considered longer ones as well, the figure would have been even more immense.  The great majority of sequences can never have been synthesized at all, at any time.â

p. 88:
âAn honest man, armed with all the knowledge available to us now, could only state that in some sense, the origin of life appears at the moment to be almost a miracle, so many are the conditions which would have had to have been satisfied to get it going.  ...The plain fact is that the time available was too long, the many microenvironments on the earthâs surface too diverse, the various chemical possibilities too numerous and our own knowledge and imagination too feeble to allow us to be able to unravel exactly how it might or might not have happened such a long time ago, especially as we have no experimental evidence from that era to check our ideas against.â ---

Crick, Francis, Life Itself: Its Origin and Nature (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1981) 192 pp. 

&gt; ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; ""

Also, maybe I am interpreting this differently than you, but I understand that to mean that Congress will not respect the *establishment* of one particular religion (ie, the Anglican Church of England). This doesn't mean that government cannot be influenced by religion (as this is again, democracy), but rather that it will not establish one religion as the national one."

"Argument for dynamic typing.

My reaction? Yes and no.

It is convenience at low cost in terms of errors and bloating we are actually talking about.

It's true that a fairly good coder will get further quicker with Python and I like the language, but I've already run into enough run-time trouble (like accidentally truncing floats by adding them to integer variables, and having a library's incompatible string types that I needed to always cast to str() anyway), and testing will only take you only so much beyond simple bordercases. And yes, neither testing or strong typing is ideal, but I don't like not actually writing types in what is acually a typed language - imagine having to type 'int' in Python. would that destroy all its good? And what happened to the complaints about function and especially operator overloading in C++?
That said, I would probably prefer inferential typing like OCaml has. No time wasted, and never ambigious.

Of course, the main point here and in various discussion as of late is 'good programmer'. Clean programmers will often treat variables as if they were statically typed anyhow just because it's more transparent and there's rarely a reason not to. A bad programmer will write spaghetti both ways. You can onyl really argue against a language's syntax when it lures even okay coders into bad code. (often details like perhaps java's exceptions, which invite you to either become extremely verbose, or catch and re-throw exceptions, the latter destroying the useful part of the stack trace, rendering exceptions half-useless)

Frankly, you can say any of this for any abstraction - and, like for most of them, also that you need to know know the rules to break them. For example, I'd say you cannot handle dynamic typing well without understanding typing."

"Yes, elisp is cool, but I'd rather just sit down and use my editor, rather than rewrite (for instance) the indentation functions.

"Stossel doesn't have a very good idea how the Belgian school system works. 

In Belgium all schools are government-subsidized (including universities and other higher eduction, by the way - my university education cost me about $400 per year in fees). There are public schools (government-run) and 'free' schools (mostly Catholic, a smaller percentage using alternative education systems like Steiner schools e.a.). 

So all schools are subsidized, but they are not all government run. There's quite a range to choose from - from disciplinarian Catholic schools to anything-goes Steiner-like schools. 

Now, there still are large difference even between government-run schools. The teaching staff has a lot of choice in how to fill in the curriculum. And location makes a difference - e.g. if a kindergarten school is located in an immigrant neighbourhood, the teachers need to spend a lot of effort teaching Dutch to the children that don't speak it at home, which is kind of boring for those that do.

EDIT: Actually, after reading that article a bit closer and actually viewing the 20/20 episode, I think I was wrong saying he doesn't 'get' the Belgian school system. I got the impression he was kind of misusing the Belgian situation to prove a point he was trying to make about competition, but having seen the episode I think it's actually pretty well reasoned."

"Well, I wouldn't call them funny. But they are extremely interesting."
"Given evidence that private schools can educate better for less money, will your opinion hold?  I would hope not, and this is the reason I will not be sending my children to public schools even though I'll probably have to pay for that particular money sink."
"That's a patent falsehood (no pun intended). My sister works as a clinical investigator for one of the larger pharmas and she sees the money that flows into it, as well as the time and effort. The scope of clinical trials is so huge that there are postgraduate degrees focusing solely on that topic. And ""the public"" doesn't finance drug tests, nor does it finance FDA compliance (in actuality, the drug companies pay for the privelege of being certified as 'safe' by the FDA). Those costs are borne by the drug companies.

Secondly, with the way gov't is so intricately intertwined in everyday life, it's hard to find examples of ANY kind of work where the government (which Chomsky equates with ""the public"" when it's doing stuff he likes, and with ""the ruling class"" when it's not) IS NOT involved at some level. That doesn't mean that because the government funds research in woodland development, mining and smelting that Chomsky doesn't own the 36,000 sq.ft. home of his in a swanky Boston suburb (or the 14,000 sq.ft. vacation edition), that was built with wood, stone and metal; that the US military has bankrolled his research since he started doesn't mean he has no right to the massive salary MIT pays him. That the government assumes the risk of saving his life, in the event he sinks one of his 4 yachts doesn't mean he isn't entitled to those, either. So that is yet another example of Chomsky talking out his ass. But then, Chomsky's been lying for a living for years, and most of his starstruck acolytes, like teenage girls with the latest Tiger Beat heartthrob, will gobble up everything he says.  A requiem for critical thinking is in order."

"This is basic economics/human nature - people work for incentives, both positive and negative.  The negative incentives for poor performance have been removed from the public schools.  Yes, there are good teachers, but they are from the smaller percentage of the population that can self-motivate.  The majority of humans need both postive and negative reinforcement to live up to their potential.

We have all seen this happen in the private sector - a poorly managed company that does not use real-world performance metrics to measure and reward/punish good work will find itself filled with slackers that surf the web and drink a lot of coffee.  The difference is, in the private sector, these companies eventually become unprofitable and fail.  In the public sector, the revenue stream is guaranteed no matter what the performance of the unit is, and thus...public schools that do half as good with twice the money as a simple, old-fashioned catholic school, with the same kids in the same neighborhoods.

Sarcasm aside, I don't see how what I wrote deserved that response, so I'll clarify a few things in the hope we can have a reasonable conversation:

* I wanted the wording of my reaction to Dawkins's beliefs to convey extreme distaste without any sense of urgency or need for action.  Thus I could suggest, without explicitly stating, my *opinion* that this interview probably embodies the sort of posturing that a public intellectual with a documentary out and a book forthcoming might use to boost his exposure, and therefore not to be taken seriously.

* Am I correct in assuming you think I'm faulting Dawkins for going to Church *too much* to be a credible atheist?  On the contrary, my own experience with church was similar, and I've reached conclusions that are different only in degree.  But I would never claim that twice-yearly church services in my early childhood and halfhearted attempts to read the scripture qualify me to pass judgement on the worldview of a billion other human beings.  I find it surpassingly lame that Dawkins does.

* I'd be happy to prove that I am in fact an atheist.  How do you suggest I do that?

* I spent my college years in Chapel Hill, North Carolina -- a very liberal university town in a very conservative state.  I know a fair bit about ""out there"" stereotyping by the culture at large, though I admit I've never been to Beserkeley.  I can think of several people I knew at UNC who would be physically pained to think that a British scientist studied for two years at an American University and never learned that firing professors for their religious beliefs (or lack thereof) is just not done here.  Would that not be the case at UCB?"

"""This should come as no surprise once you remember that public education in the USA is a government monopoly""

The reason in USA may be this, but I want to share a different
experience. In Italy education was mostly government monopoly, much more monopoly than it is in the United States. In the past decades
Italian school was at the top of european standards, but now it is no
longer true, for multiple reasons. Social changes (today a lot of people graduates, teachers are no longer selected as they were in the past),
a reform that made the school more like a company: now school managers
tend to lower the level of the school so kids will select this simpler school
instead of an hard one: more kids, more money. Also in the past it was
possible to selectively reject a kid for math, or latin, now you can
either pass or be rejected for the whole year.

Another counter-example of this may be Cuba: schools are a
government monopoly there but education level is high compared
to other more freedom countries speding a similar amount of money
in education."
Neat idea.
It's supposed to be meant to make the kids more equal (e.g. so the poorer ones don't get teased for having crappy clothes).
"Recently, an Indiana State Rep. suggested paying teachers based on their class state test results... Think about this: schools in impovrished areas have lower test scores than areas where the wealthier/higher class live. Can you imagine how quickly good teachers would flock to those ""better"" areas, away from the kids who have lower test scores (and teachers actually get parental support)? To me, this idea is the same logic that Stossel uses.

The main point: IT IS NOT THE TEACHERS THAT IS THE PROBLEM. Yes, we all had several teachers that were idiots, but if you look at the system you need to realize that teachers are constrained by ADMIN, parents, government, the unions and other fellow teachers. Good teachers can't teach anymore because the methods that work aren't PC anymore.

My wife is a teacher and spends 75% of her time disciplining kids whose parents never taught them discipline. She has to act like a lawyer and gather enough evidence to prove the she did not ""make up"" allegations of misbehavior, otherwise the parents go nuts (my kid can never do wrong-syndrome) and she gets in big trouble (which then necessitates the union's existence to back her up, which should be ADMIN's job, but they're too scared of not being PC enough in front of the parents, who do not have to account to anyone).

Blaming the teacher is just finding a scapegoat and not addressing the real issues, or at least understanding that it's a lot more complex than bad teachers or ""no child left behind.""

Also, you can't compare a country like the US to Belgium. That's asinine. Are the two countries similar in a good amount of major categories? Not really."

"Using standardized testing to grade and reward schools wonât work because it doesnât encourage teachers to teach well.  Instead it encourages them to teach the test.

""Since the US government cannot market a product, the National Institute of Health (NIH) awarded Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) with an exclusive ten-year license to market and sell ddI [didanosine] as VidexÂ® tablets. At the end of the ten-year period, BMS re-formulated VidexÂ® as Videx ECÂ® and patented that.""

Allow me a private story also: my father has worked for a long time in both privately and publically not-for-profit funded labs across the world (Russia, Germany, and the US), before recently starting work in a small pharmaceutical startup (now public). The biggest differences he noticed are: ~40% salary increase, enormous budget for anything he wants to do (relative to not-for-profit ventures), and an absolutely staggering lack of motivation to do actual research among the other staff. The main point of having a for-profit company isn't research, it's profit. Why would anyone think otherwise?"

"&gt; 13) Google WON'T go head-to-head with Microsoft for a desktop operating system or a cheap PC.

This is pretty obvious.  It won't happen in 2006, but it will definately happen.  I think it is likely that that ""desktop operating system"" will become irrelevent; just a platform on which to run the web browser.  Most people will stop buying Windows and Mac OS and will instead switch to free OS's provided by Google, Sun, and eventually Microsoft. 

&gt; 12) Intel is spending $2 billion to re-brand itself as a consumer electronics company because the future is in being cheaper, not faster. The next big consumer market will be a network computing appliance. When it hits anyone's processor can be used and Intel will be$2 billion behind.

I don't know if Intel is wasting its money or not.  I believe that the next big consumer market is the handheld network computing appliance.  First, America has to discover that cellphones are for more than just talking - they're for using the Internet.

Here's my prediction for 2006 (or what I think would be cool, even if it is highly unlikely):
  Handheld computer makers, like blackberry, palm, handspring, and cellphone manufacturers, will FINALLY put chorded keyboards on their devices.  Kids and power users will be the first to adopt the new typing style, and everybody else will slowly catch on over several years.  Maybe in 2008 we'll see handhelds that have no buttons but are operated by touch-screens and chorded keys on the periphery of the device.

Second prediction: American cellphone companies will completely miss this innovation and will continue to offer poor cellphones with horrible software.  A Japanese cellphone company (maybe AU) will bring Japanese-quality cellphones into the US market and capture all of the young customers."

The water temperature is not uniform, so it is necessary to find a spot that is the proper distance from the hot water pipes to suit your preference.

Lounging on a holiday with friends is fun.  Soaking in a tub of hot water is very relaxing, but it can get boring.  The Japanese have figured out how to combine the two together!

Anyone, including Moore, makes valid points and dumb ones. It's too convenient to those who love to dismiss Moore's valid points by nitpicking on things that have nothing to do with them. 
Especially as no one seems to have asked him why. Maybe he's a hypocrite, and maybe he bought a tiny percentage of shares so that he can justify going to stockholder meetings without getting kicked out for being a pain in the ass, and/or raising a shitstorm if he is kicked out. Anyone who calls him a hypocrite based on the few sentences here glosses over the fact that that would be a pretty smart thing to do.

I am getting really annoyed by internet 'journalism' that is reporting a single fact and then screaming about it.

While we are doing things cheaper, why don't we privatize the military? We could have private companies develope our armed forces, the best militias would protect our country.

But you understand that the people who benefit from that research get it free.

I welcome grade inflation.  The time is coming when an A+ means 'pass' and anything else means 'fail'.  There will be no way to distinguish excellent from ordinary performance.

1. Mr. Edmundson might have 5 students in the 50 who care deeply about Friday. Maybe 10; more would require the admissions office at U.Va. to have mastered time travel. He has almost as many who've transferred in at the last minute because of schedule conflicts, and a broad middle bunch in to fulfill a requirement and get a grade. For about 80% of the class, then, Mr. Edmundson is the keeper of one of about 40 gates they must pass through to get that degree.

2. Let's imagine two students, Jim Bored and Jane Engaged. Jim cares not for Freud, but he needs the credits toward his degree, which in turn he needs because he wishes to go to law school. Indifferent though he is to Freud, he does the reading, does the writing, at semester's end can give a lucid account of Thanatos, Eros, Oedipus, and the psychopathology of everyday life. Jane, heaven help her, wants to go to grad school in the humanities, and someone has suggested the class to her. She does the reading, and quickly comes to agree with Karl Kraus that psychoanalysis is a disease masquerading as a cure. She bags the class, and spends the time it would have taken in reading Kraus, on to Von Hoffmanstal, Musil, etc., etc., really engaged intellectually. Mr. Edmundson will I suppose have no option but to give her an F, unless U.Va. has provision for long-term Incompletes.

So now Jim will get his B.A., and Jane perhaps not. Whatever they know about Freud, kids who get into U.Va. understand the degree/no-degree distinction in their bones. 

Sorry about that, Mr. Edmundson."

_Chatterjee added that the public image of Mother Teresa as a ""helper of the poor"" was misleading, and that only a few hundred people are served by even the largest of the homes._

_Many of Teresa's donors were evidently under the impression that their money was being used to build hospitals. In 1991, Dr. Robin Fox, then editor of the British medical journal The Lancet, visited the Home for Dying Destitutes in Calcutta (now Kolkata) and described the medical care the patients received as ""haphazard"". He observed that sisters and volunteers, some of whom had no medical knowledge, had to make decisions about patient care, because of the lack of doctors in the hospice. Dr. Fox specifically held Teresa responsible for conditions in this home, and observed that her order did not distinguish between curable and incurable patients, so that people who could otherwise survive would be at risk of dying from infections and lack of treatment._

_Fox conceded that the regimen he observed included cleanliness, the tending of wounds and sores, and kindness, but he noted that the sisters' approach to managing pain was ""disturbingly lacking""._"

I dare you to go through the New Testament and show me a single teaching of Christ that is negative toward human beings and their treatment of others in anyway.

For us the international crowd: what does GPA stand for?
"My first programming job asked for my GPA.  My 3.7 was sufficient, though I was not happy with it because it reflected the one and only C in my college career.  Interestingly I was on the student side of a grade dispute regarding this; I made a complaint to the Dean about the instructor, and he passed it along to her before she issued my final grade.  There was no way she could give me a D so she did the next best thing.  Once in a while I think about submitting my ""C minus"" paper for possible publication to the Newfoundland Historical Society.  By the way, this comes from somebody whose SAT scores are from the era before THEY became inflated, and my scores are high enough for automatic membership in Mensa, so this was not an issue of lack of talent.  Long story short, there can be two sides to these stories."

"Wait, so you are going to discredit Mother Theresa's work because of her own limitations that she could do very little about?

Really, just cut out the rhetoric. The woman was out doing what she could. Yet somehow you are going to try and discredit what she did. Yeah, I'm sure that's easy to do while you sit on your PC at home and live a nice life. Its not so easy when you give up your life to help others and face the reality of that day by day.

She wasn't perfect, no one is...but at least she was doing something. Can you say the same for yourself?

I know what it is like. I worked as a missionary down in the slums of South Dallas last summer. We worked with crack addicts, prostitutes, etc. The first two weeks I was there there were 3 murders within about 1/2 a mile. Its not an easy life. You have to make tough decisions. Sometimes you don't have enough money to help someone. Sometimes people use you just to continue with their addictions. But you try. And that's all you really can do.

The church I worked at was poor, and when I say poor, I mean poor. It wasn't any megachurch with seating for 40,000, it was a single-room building with seating for maybe 75. But this little church had managed to rent out an apartment complex across the street, renovate it, and was now serving homeless people food every other day. They provided medical care to prostitutes and crack addicts. Sometimes I wonder what some of those people would do if that church wasn't there. And the pastor? I think that man worked about 15 hours a day. I promise you he wasn't getting a lot of money for doing it. But he loved people, and he is still currently giving up his life to help others.

And you should have the respect to not try and shoot that down with petty criticisms.

_Okay, so Theresa had to make difficult decisions about medical care because they didn't have enough doctors. Is that a fault of her own?_

Yes. The order received hundreds of millions of dollars, but chose _not_ to use it to alleviate the suffering of the poor.

Mother Theresa's mission was a _religious_ one, and despite being probably the richtest religious order in the world (to the tune of probably $100 million in donations per year), despite this money being given by donors to alleviate the suffering of the poor, the poor were helped little at all, and the donors were cheated (with the money probably going to the Vatican, not to the poor).

I'll just point to this translation of an article in the German magazine 'Stern':

http://are.berkeley.edu/~atanu/Writing/teresa.html

_All this points to one thing, something that Mother Teresa reiterated very frequently in her speeches and addresses -- that she far more concerened with life after death than the mortal life._

_Mother Teresa's business was : Money for a good conscience. The donors benefitted the most from this. The poor hardly. Whosoever believed that Mother Teresa wanted to cahnge the world, eliminate suffering or fight poverty, simply wanted to believe it for their own sakes. Such people did not listen to her. To be poor, to suffer was a goal, almost an ambition or an achievement for her and she imposed this goal upon those under her wings; her actual ordained goal was the hereafter._

_With growing fame, the founder of the order became somewhat conscious of the misconceptioons on which the Mother Teresa phenomenon was based. She wrote a few words and hung them outside Mother House:_

_""Tell them we are not here for work, we are here for Jesus. We are religious above all else. We are not social workers, not teachers, not doctors. We are nuns.""_

_One question then remains: For what, in that case, do nuns need so much money?_
"
fun site.... period.
"I'm trying to figure out what point you are trying to make. Is it that religious people aren't perfect? I think that's obvious.

_I promise you he wasn't getting a lot of money for doing it. But he loved people, and he is still currently giving up his life to help others. And you should have the respect to not try and shoot that down with petty criticisms._

Now _this_ is rhetorical, in fact it is rather sneakily sophist of you to suggest I would criticize such a commendable effort, by yourself and by the pastor. I have more respect for this paster (and, actually, for your actions in this) than for someone with hundreds of millions in the bank with the religious conviction that it would be a mistake to use that money to alleviate the suffering of the poor.

_Again, you feel it necessary to try and discredit the work of a women who gave up her life for others...I want to know, what is it that you are doing for others?_

Not enough! Not enough. But, uh, I didn't receive like, oh, a _billion_ dollars in donations over the years, did I?

I agree that the article is worth reading. I doubt I'll find time for the book. My negative reaction is less about anything objective than it is about the bad feeling I get from the phrase.
"Microsoft showed off some of its technologies in development Thursday at its Redmond campus, although it wouldn't allow reporters to see them all. One tool, which could be available in the next year, tries to predict a user's age and gender based on Web sites the person visits.

Another system could home in on the outfit a person is wearing in a television show and tell viewers where to buy similar clothing.

For example, viewers of Sex And The City could click on Carrie Bradshawâs designer shoes as she walks down a New York street and be taken straight to the shoemakerâs website

One research project would show advertisers the breakdown of users visiting a particular Web site based on their age, gender and location.

The adLab was borne partly out of a sense of urgency that now was the time for Microsoft to take a leadership position in the online advertising market. Key to that was improving ways to target ads to Internet users."
"The point I am trying to make is that I consider the religious order of Mother Theresa to be a huge black hole into which a lot of goodwill and money from millions of people has disappeared, without producing the results that those people were rightfully expecting.

One myth debunked
"Doubtlessly, people will commit evil deeds with or without religion. I acknowledge that in the name of religion, countless good works have been done, but also, countless intolerances have been promoted. Christianity, a most familiar case study, has a messiah who is the ultimate pacifist. There is no ambiguity with the avatar who taught his followers to offer the other cheek to the transgressor. An eight-year-old should be able to pick up on that one, but apparently century after century of kings and dictators were unable to grasp it, even while they proclaimed to carry Christ's banners.

This isn't a thing of the past either. I'm assuming you've read the new testament pretty well. Could you please explain how an administration that so enthusiastically led a country to war could be led by someone who claims to pray to Jesus daily for guidance? Maybe there's another Jesus I missed? 

Admittedly, he could be one of a few misguided souls, but if that's the case, how come the organized political wing of the Christian Right supports him so staunchly, and church goers overwhelmingly voted for him? I understand that there's a lot more at stake than war, but I just can't reconcile that one. The residual Christian in me sees it as a deal breaker.

Oh, and one more little thing. You should see the pamphlets snuck into care packages and sent to soldiers in Iraq by the Christian fundamentalist congregations. I still got a few. My favorite one has a picture of a muslim in arab garb burning in hellfire, bowing down and saying ""Jesus Christ is Lord!"" as he is judged. I really should scan those and get them posted.

Religion can attempt to use its 'carrot and stick' approach to guide its adherents on to the...hmmm...what, right path? Saved path? But ultimately, the only thing that has a chance is for people to have empathy for the plight of their fellow human. And you can't fear or bribe that into someone. 

Oh, and by the way, I really like Jesus and his teachings, I just need to keep his followers the hell away from me.

"_The next life is merely a continuation of the first._

Granted, during my 12 years of Catholic schooling I did not pay a great deal of attention, but when the 'next life' is forever, and you really, _really_ believe this is true, as Mother Theresa did, then the pain and suffering in this life are of less importance, and probably beneficial to the soul. Her actions (or inaction) are logical seen from her belief in the afterlife. From a non-believer's point of view, her order has squandered a great opportunity to help the weak and alleviate the pain of the suffering, and has sucked up a great deal of money that was intended to be used in such a way.

_People who take such actions and give up their lives for others aren't ""throwing away"" their lives...they are using it for anothers' benefit. Its just about the most selfless thing you can do. I'm not sure how its morally repulsive._

I wasn't talking about _their_ lives (i.e. ""The Missionaries of Charity""), I was talking about the lives of the ones that turned to them for help.

You have misinterpreted what I wrote, so I will try to explain myself again. Mother Theresa's driving force was her belief, which led her not to take the actions that a humanistic western world would have expected her to take, but led her to care more for the souls than for the bodies of those in her care. In the logic of the true believer, it is more important to save a soul from eternal damnation than it is to cure their tuberculosis - in fact a bit of suffering is good for the soul. Baptising is more important than sterilizing needles. That is the inescapable logic if you truly believe in the afterlife. This was the belief of Mother Theresa. And the Catholic church agrees, since Mother Theresa is well on her way to sainthood (she has already been beatified).

Since I am not a great believer in the existence of the eternal soul, I find this devaluation of life morally repugnant."

"Grade Point Average

For every class that a student completes, a number of points are earned.  The number of points is given by the following equation:

Points = (# credit hours) x (grade points)

Where the credit hours roughly corresponds to the number of hours that the class meets per week.  In American universities and colleges, students can expect that for every hour spent in the classroom, 2-3 hours will be necessary outside the classroom for homework and studying.  In one semester, the typical student takes 3-5 classes, for a total of about 15 credit hours.  A 12 credit hour schedule is considered 'full-time' and earns eligibility for financial aid.

Grade points are assigned by a grading scale.  The most common scale is the 4.0 scale, where A=4, B=3, C=2, D=1, F=0.  Most schools do not use 'E'.  Anything below a 'D' is considered failing, and receives 'F'.

My Software Engineering class meets three times a week, MWF, from 12 to 12:50.  This is 2.5 hours of actual time in class, but the class is for 3 credit hours.  If I receive an 'A' in the class, I will get 3x4 = 12 points.

The Grade Point Average is calculated from all classes for which the student has received grade points:

GPA = SUM(grade points) / SUM(credit hours)

The semester GPA includes classes taken in a particular semester.  The 'cumulative' GPA includes all classes that the student has taken in university.

A student must earn only 'A's to get a 4.0 GPA.  A student who receives an equal number of 'A's as 'B's will have a GPA around 3.50.  Each grade's contribution to the GPA is weighted by the class's number of credit hours.  This means that a 4 hour class has more affect on your GPA than a 3 hour class.

Let's take a hypothetical student, called Joe.  Joe has just begun his third year in university (he's a Junior).  He has already taken 56 credit hours of classes, for which he has earned 191 grade points.

Joe's current cumulative GPA = 191 / 56 = 3.41

This indicates that Joe receives roughly equal numbers of 'A's and 'B's.  Or for every 'C' that Joe receives, he earns three 'A's to make up for it.  Now let's look at Joe's schedule for this semester:

3 credits Software Design

3 credits Linear Algebra

3 credits Intermediate Japanese I

4 credits Physics II

3 credits Introduction to Sociology
--
16 credits total

Let's pretend that it is the end of the semester and Joe is expecting to receive an 'A' in Linear Algebra, a 'B' in Software Design, and an 'A' in Japanese.  His grades for Physics and Sociology are hovering between 'A's and 'B's.  These two classes have pending assignments that will swing the grades to 'A' or to 'B'.  Joe is a pretty good student but he didn't manage his time very well and now doesn't have enough time to do an excellent job on both assignments.  Should Joe choose to earn an 'A' in Physics and a 'B' in Sociology, or vice versa?  The merits of the two subjects aside, let's look at the effect on his GPA.  An 'A' in Physics will earn 16 grade points while an 'A' in Sociology would earn 12.  A 'B' in Physics earns 12 grade points, while a 'B' in Sociology earns 9.  He's anticipating these grade points:

191 points (previously earned)

9 points for a 'B' in Software Design (3 hr)

12 points for an 'A' in Linear Algebra (3 hr)

12 points for an 'A' in Intermediate Japanese I (3 hr)

16 or 12 points for Physics II (4 hr)

12 or 9 points for Introduction to Sociology (3 hr)

When the semester is finished, he will have 56+16=72 hours of earned credit.  If he gets an 'A' in Physics and a 'B' in Sociology then he will earn 58 grade points.  If he goes for an 'B' in Physics and an 'A' in Sociology then he will get 57 grade points.  How will this affect his cumulative GPA?

Cumulative GPA = (191+58)/72 = 249/72 = 3.458 = 3.46

Cumulative GPA = (191+57)/72 = 248/72 = 3.444 = 3.44

Joe perceives himself to be in the interval between 3.0 and 4.0, so the choice appears to have a bearing of 2% on his cumulative GPA!  This is flawed reasoning that snares many students.  Joe must remember that he will have earned about 130 credit hours when he graduates.  If his GPA is 3.5 then he will have 455 grade points.  His choice between an 'A' in Physics and an 'A' in Sociology accounts for only 1/455 or 0.2% of his final GPA.

The typical engineering student spends at least 3 years thinking about his GPA.  Students who begin thinking about their GPA after their first year of study will probably graduate in 4 years.  Engineering students who take 2 years to realize their academic peril usually require 5 years to graduate.

The GPA is our slave master.  Students with more than 3.5 feel that every grade less than an 'A' is a black mark on their transcript because it brings their GPA down.  They work so hard for their grades and give up social activities to spend more time studying.

In my opinion, the comfortable region is between 3.1 and 3.5.  Students in this region are earning 'A's and 'B's and can afford to get a 'C' in a class that is very boring.  These students may be just as smart as the &gt;3.5 students, but they make different choices.  Some of them would be &gt;3.5 but they have to work and don't have much time to study.

The biggest injustice of the GPA system is that everyone looks at the cumulative GPA, which represents the student's entire undergraduate career.  Students who have difficulty adjusting to life at university often earn poor grades in their first and second years.  These poor grades mar the GPA and make significant improvement impossible.  Even if a student consistently earns 3.75 in each subsequent semester, the cumulative GPA can remain very low.  Most graduate school programs have minimum cumulative GPA requirements.  Many employers look only at the cumulative GPA when evaluating a new graduate's academic performance.  The knowledge of this can evince an enormous amount of stress for the struggling first or second year student.

In my opinion, schools should calculate a 2-year GPA rather than a cumulative GPA.  At least, employers and graduate schools should request the semester GPAs for the final 4 semesters of a student's undergraduate studies.  These scores will show any improvement in the student's performance that may be hidden in a cumulative GPA."
"""I agree with everything except your last line. You really thing the solution is to kick people out of college? I keep running into this elitism thats starting to bug me.""

Actually, I think he's dead-on. He's not talking about ""kicking people out"" of college, and it's not elitism. The only reason it *seems* like elitism is because our culture has an irrational obsession with college education. A university degree used to be a special thing that only a certain percentage of people -- a certain number of professions -- really had any need for. Now it is seen as the bare minimum requirement for anything other than a minimum-wage service job. And the sad truth is that, in many cases, a person's degree has little or nothing to do with the profession they end up in; and even if it does, the reality of that profession is often wildly different from what they learned in school. Result: they (or, more likely, their parents) blew tens of thousands of dollars for a piece of paper in order to gain entry to a job that they would have been no less qualified for without a day of college.

We don't need to kick people out of college (unless they're failing, of course), but we -- as parents, employers, companies, and a society -- do need to stop indoctrinating our children with the notion that college is the One True Path for Success. There are plenty of people who need a higher education for what they want to do with their lives, and plenty of people who can benefit from it in general. There are also plenty of people who have no need for it, or at least don't need to jump into it right out of high school. We are drastically misusing our universities, and the results are not the least bit surprising."

"I was falling asleep for the most part but the last part caught my attention. It provided a piece to a puzzle that I had for a while regarding the mindset of the Chinese people (people in China not Chinese outside of China).

China, for the longest time (witness the emperors, warlords, communist party), create wealth through power not innovation. 
The whole system and society are geared towards power wealth.

Now with the rapidly opening of China, the influx of technology and blooming startups, the old ""ways"" have not caught up to the new reality. Hence the ""weird"" practices encountered by westerners or even more liberal asians.

On the surface, many Chinese can grasp this concept. But the actual execution is subjected to much contortion.

The sheer number of people, the unique political ecosystem and the ""thousand years of culture"" surely make change daunting.

Nevertheless unprecedented wealth creation in China as we speak.

Great piece!"

The Pythagoras technique cannot actually _verify_ that a rectangle is true, it can only suggest measurements that _should_ work and does not take into account failures of implementation."

The passing mark was *supposed* to be 40%, but the faculty realised that there was no way the majority of the class would be able to achieve that, and so they had to decide whether to cancel the course altogether, or simply pass everybody.  Needless to say, they passed everybody.

Law himself, under oath, alluded to the possibility of diplomatic immunity due to this.

Personally, this made me wonder whether Congress explicitly consents to American citizens becoming ""Princes"" of Vatican City upon being promoted to Cardinals.  Otherwise, the practice is explicitly in conflict with the Constitution, and the Cardinal accepting the title of nobility, from a foreign power, without the consent of Congress, should immediately be arrested."

"I guess you didn't know that Orwell was a socialist, probably way to the left of Tim Robbins. The book is a study of totalitarianism and particularly the role of censorship. It is not about socialism at all, but about how a  country can become a totalitarian nightmare by frightening the population into giving up liberties and accepting censorship. It was based on his experiences working for the UK government censoring news stories on the pretext of national security during the war. After the war, a lot of prohibitions carried on and the book's title is a play on the year of publication, 1948; it is showing a nightmare future and saying this could be us if we carry on down this path."

"I've known people all my life that would gladly commit any level of sin just to get a good grade in a course, or on a test. As far as I'm concerned, that's great!!! All that means is that when they ACTUALLY have to get some work done, when they have a job... they won't be capable of doing their work due to the ill-preparedness of their studies. Although, It does make me wonder how many people fall into this category. 

All of these students are doing themselves a disservice by trying to lower the bar of their own success. It definitely sucks through school (why did that guy get an A, while I was in class and never saw him), but the professional world works a _bit_ differently at least. I EARNED my C in college, because I didn't go to class or study. But I am the wiser, because I learned my lesson. 

And the comments about how 'valued' a college education really is are right on. Most jobs have always required experience, not strict academic education. Lots of kids want those jobs, but are forced to suffer through school and debt just to get there. The four lost years of job experience are more of a detriment to them than any one class they endured is a benefit."

How about an inside-out or outside-in approach. Try finding the innermost or outermost loop of connected nodes. Spread them in a circle and work your way inwards/outwards. I think nodes with only two connections (or edges if you will) have a higher probability to lie inside the outermost loop. So you start by dragging them towards the center aswell.
"First time I heard Nazis described as socialists. One of Orwell's big objections to Soviet Russia was that it was perceived as socialist when it was nothing of the kind. He saw Stalinism as equivalent to any other form of fascism which made him unpopular with certain elements of the left (and the UK government who tried to block publication when Russia was an ally). As far as I understand he didn't turn on his socialist views at all, rather ironic that the book jacket should say that he did.

""Because of the obvious anti-communism in Nineteen Eighty-Four, the book was a great success in the USA where McCarthyism had just reared its head. It was overlooked, however, that Orwell in the book says that all ideologies in the mid-twentieth century were authoritarian. Because Nineteen Eighty-Four was misinterpreted and in some cases misused, Orwell wrote in 1949: 

My recent novel is NOT intended as an attack on Socialism or on the British Labour Party (of which I am a supporter) but as a show-up of the perversions to which a centralized economy is liable and which have already been partly realized in communism and Fascism. I do not believe that the kind of society I describe necessarily will arrive, but I believe (allowing of course for the fact that the book is a satire) that something resembling it could arrive. I believe also that totalitarian ideas have taken root in the minds of intellectuals everywhere, and I have tried to draw these ideas out to their logical consequences.""

    ""Every line of serious work that I have written
    since 1936 has been written, directly or indirectly,
    against totalitarianism and for democratic Socialism,
    as I understand it.""

What I completely fail to understand is how a society can be socialist but not totalitarian (in corresponding degree).  In a socialist society the government takes, under the threat of force, the fruits of the laboror, for the ""greater good"".

To me, the threat or use of government force against its citizens is the definition of totalitarianism.  It doesn't matter if the government was democratically elected or seized power - the net result is the same and only varies by degrees.

As a result, all governments lie somewhere on the spectrum between total anarchy and complete totalitarianism.  As an objectivist / libertarian I am a lot more comfortable erring towards the anarchist end of the spectrum."

Unsuccessful, the other student finally left and I entered.  I asked for my grade and she told me it was a C.  I thanked her and started to leave but she called me back.  She wanted to explain that I was writing well but wasn't careful about spelling and so that's why I had earned a C.  I told her I understood and tried to leave again but she stopped me one more time.  She made a bargain with me.  If I promised to be more careful in the next English class then she would raise my current grade.  I got the B.

&gt; The German Nazis (""National Socialists"") used the word ""socialist"" in their official name, but some scholars argue that this was done purely for propaganda purposes and that they tended to adopt either a pro-worker or pro-business line depending on the given audience. The Nazis did demand some nationalization of big industries and land reform before their rise to power. However, once in power, they allowed (friendly) capitalists to thrive while liquidating socialists everywhere (including from within their own party in the Night of the Long Knives). As Hitler himself explained - he would not repeat the mistake of Lenin and put the party leaders in charge of industries, since they don't have enough knowledge and experience. His idea was to allow the capitalists to control their companies if they did it effectively, and obeyed the orders of the national-socialist party.

"Sriram Krishnan seems to be making a couple different points in his post.

1) CL and Scheme aren't easy to use for commom programming tasks.  There are issues with library availablity and compatability with a specific implementation.  

2) As languages like C# and Python evolve, they will become the inheiritors of the Lisp legacy, and the masses of programmers will finally use Lisp concepts because they already know the rest of the programming language.

As for point #1, I think the Lisp community is more aware of this, and it has become a higher priority.  But there are definitely some big hurdles still to overcome here.  I don't forsee much contraversy on this point.

As for point #2... I don't agree with that at all.  He seems to make the point that learning the advanced concepts of CS like closures, continuations, and FP style are too difficult for the majority of programmers.

So why does he think it will be easier for these programmers to learn and use these concepts when they are wrapped up in a clunky syntax in C# or Python?  If they can't wrap their heads around such concepts, then they can't.  It doesn't matter if it is Scheme, CL, C# or Python.

Here's the thing.  I could get much of the power and expressiveness I get from Lisp with some other language, notably Python or Ruby.  But I don't want to compromise on this, I want all the power!  I want to be able to write code which is as beautiful as I am capable of."

"There's any number of things that could have been wrong with the way the study was conducted, but perhaps the most obvious unknown factor is what age of children the parents had. Were they parents of angst-filled only-child teeny-bopper? Or triplets in diapers? Did the families have a stay at home parent, or were both pursuing careers all day and then coming home exhausted?

And the million-dollar question: Did they ask any parents with *grown up* children? Is the old couple who spent their fertile years indulging in themselves really as happy as the one that raised a family, and now hosts a Christmas reunion every year?"

There are many reasons people remove hair, for example no hair in certain places reduces body odor, there are also advantages I won't mention here. Smooth skin does feel nice, but obviously the main reason for a lot of people is aesthetic and many aesthetic principles can be put forward without resorting to children.

But I can also do some amateur pop-psychology analysis that reduces everybody's individual feelings and experiences into one simple sentence yet still sounds kinda plausible as long as you don't think too hard: Men are naturally hairier than women, so more hair is naturally associated with masculinity and less hair with femininity, by removing all hair you can widen that gap and push yourself even further over to the feminine direction.

"The slashdotter's appreciation of the difference in value systems is right on, though his subtle suggestion of rational discourse between the differing sides is not. It's too late. Globalization has pervaded a society that has largely stagnated in economic, social, and governmental evolution (or GROWTH if the term 'evolution' strikes you as too politically incorrect). The consumer goods of the west or their knockoffs have shown up en masse, and satellite dishes with hot chips hang from the balconies of level after level of government built ghettos. They've seen what they don't have, there aren't many promising jobs or even a distant hope of one, and they have religious leaders antagonizing them further by insisting that what intrigues them is the work of the devil. It was nearly enough to make one miss the Christian fundamentalists, but not quite.

On top of that, there was a wounded pride that was shared regardless of religious sect or ethnic difference, which is really something, since you could construct a complex flow chart of who hates who just going by those factors. The Shiites hate the Sunnis, the Sunnis hate the Shiites, and the Kurds see them both as dogs. They all support the Palestinians against the Israelis (anti-semitism might be the one unifying factor I stumbled  across...or anti-Jew might be more apt, 'cause aren't most of the region technically Semitic?), which was ironic, since all of them looked at the Palestinians with a shameful disdain.

The interesting part was how many of them were disgusted with the the religious leaders that scare the west, though  this was voiced in very quite tones indicative of how they scare the locals too. I should dislose that my amateur anthropology was largely confined to college educated english speakers (in most of the area universities, particularly the technical ones, you learn english or you flunk out, since the the courses are taught in english, and the textbooks are western). They were also mostly practicing Muslims, though they reminded me of American Catholics, picking and choosing what aspects of the doctrine they would observe.

I came away from my little foray realizing just how screwed we were. The conflict between the west and the middle east, or near east, or central asia, or whatever the hell you want to label it has so many different converging factors and long building momentum that it seems inevitable. It also seems as if it shouldn't be a suprise. It also appears logical that other parts of the world (particularly Africa) will be following suit in some way as soon as it crawls out of unbelievably destitute poverty to just ridiculously destitute poverty. Envy, religion, oppression, poverty all play a roll. I don't think anyone has a clue as to how to solve it, but I'm sure that any alleviation is a lot more complex than just the application of hard power. I didn't support the justification for Iraq, and war sucks, but damn I hope it works out.

"No problem. First off, we should keep in mind that there are probably at least 36 different kinds of economy, though I often hear it simplified down to 4. We should notice that we live under a state capitalism, with massive government input. This is in contrast to the state communism of the Soviets.

The reason we don't live in a decentralized capitalism is because it apparently couldn't survive. People tend to point to histories like Polanyi's _The Great Transformation_ in explaining this (though I haven't yet gotten around to reading it). This appears to be a mainstream opinion; you can even read editorials on [The American Conservative](http://www.amconmag.com/2005_03_14/article1.html) pointing this out.

This is why people like [Einstein](http://www.monthlyreview.org/598einst.htm) searched for a kind of command economy with democratic planning.

It's interesting to hear someone talk about Norvig's book PAIP. Which he's right about, many understandably do think it's the best programming book in existence. Even given its flaws. He homes in on how Lisp users can simply ""memoize"" a function (tell it to cache its own return values so it can emit them later again, in one command). And the data-directed technique that Lisp users can use, where you enter data in your sourcecode and have that be ""executed.""

What he totally fails to see is the role that preemptive strikes by the US played in creating this anti-western sentiment and the reactions on additional actions like this.

Then I followed his Mort, Elvis, and Einstein link and found out that Mort is your typical VB programmer, Elvis is your typical C# programmer, and Einstein is the typical C++ programmer-- so Lisp does not encompass all the traits of VB, C#, and C++ but the same can be said about VB, C#, or C++!!!

I don't claim to know what did happen, but I know when I'm being lied to.  The biggest smoking gun I've seen (among many): In the very pro-official-story PBS documentary on the subject, Larry Silverstein, the lease-holder of the whole complex at the time (who took on the lease a year earlier in what an outsider would have called a very bad deal), says that, on 9/11, after building 7 had been burning for a while, they ""MADE THE DECISION TO PULL IT"".  As you can verify for yourself, 'pull' is a construction term for controlled demolition.  Officially the building lost structural integretity (and neatly collapsed into its own footprint at freefall speed).  This is important because there is no earthly way that charges could have been set up to demolish building seven on that day.  It would have taken a week with a non-burning building.  I am not a 'nut'; I am a rational human being.  Any other rational person, who isn't too frightened to examine the evidence closely, will come to the same conclusion.  The official story is not just inaccurate; it is a deliberate lie.

"This is clearly a case of self-projection. Your paraphrasing mistakenly assumes an equivalence between socialism, communism and a centralised economy where there is none. What Orwell said is more reliable than what you speculate that he might have been unable to express. It is well-known that IngSoc was a dig at people who label themselves socialists while pursuing contradictory agendas and not at socialism itself. It is not true that Orwell had a lifetime of believing in socialism. He had been an anarchist previously but rejected it quite easily on the grounds that if crime was profitable, you would either need a strongly enforced criminal justice system or live under gangster rule. He had also been a strong pacifist and changed his mind quite openly on that when he realised that Hitler needed to be defeated."

Is it sweet?

we know perfectly well that love exists. we just don't think that love ""exists"" in the same way as (say) we ourselves ""exist"", or the same way as the internet ""exists"", or (fill in the blank) ""exists"". there are many different kinds of ""things"" (objects, concepts, emotions, and so on), which may each ""exist"" in a different fashion.

Sorry, folks, but you post a Google Video link, you get a -1 from me. It's as simple as that.

And I'm not being arsey, I just think that if you find a cool video, you should post a direct link to that video -- and not to some totally unrelated third-party page that only welcomes US visitors.

I mean, look, if you find a cool article, you just post a direct link to the article -- and not to some totally unrelated page that links to the article. So why should videos be treated differently?

"A clarification: sometimes you hear this argument phrased as if ""the ecomomy"" will magically cause more oil to appear after present supplies are gone, and that's misleading.

In actuality, there's a lot of oil left in the ground that oil drillers never collect because oil drilling is usually only 30% to 70% efficient.  That figure is driven more by the world demand for oil than by limitations in extraction technology.  So as the oil price rises, it's cost-effective to recover more and more oil from existing wells.  This is one reason (taxes are another) why gas prices in the US are much lower than in Europe -- at ~ $35/bbl, lots of oil fields in Texas, Oklahoma, &amp; Louisiana ""turn on"".  

**Some people** take this argument further and say there's nothing to worry about at all, because a world oil price stays above $50/bbl for a few years would make it economical to start going after tar sands in Canada and oil shale deposits in the Rocky Mountains, although the technologies necessary to do this have never been demonstrated at scale."

"If oil is scarce, then all the car and oil companies who are ""ignoring"" the warnings would all be out of business in twenty-five years, wouldn't they?

I don't think they're that stupid. Companies are generally ruthless in being profit driven. That said, I figure they're going to milk the oil business for as much cash as they can get out of it, then ""magically"" unveil the new fuel technology once they really need it.

I've heard conspiracy theories about car companies (it might have been Ford) that developed cars that ran on water, but are keeping it under wraps on purpose. I don't know how true that is, but my guess is that they've got much more ideas up their sleeves than the current hybrid and even fuel-cell technology."

"Another thing to keep in mind is that while oil supply may be limited, coal and natural gas reserves are much larger. Estimates are 1,000,000 million short tons recoverable coal and 5,500 million short tons annual demand (natural gas numbers are in a similar ratio). These sources count for 58% of emissions, and 96% of emissions from electricity sectors. Major changes are inevitable in transportation, but oil is not the limiting factor for energy-related emissions. Given that China and India have plenty of coal, limited oil does not imply sufficient reductions in emissions.

"&gt;Any other rational person, who isn't too frightened to examine the evidence closely, will come to the same conclusion. The official story is not just inaccurate; it is a deliberate lie.

I think this is the biggest problem with conspiracy theory. As soon as a theory is denounced as being ludicrous, or irrational, the conspiracy theorists jump back and claim that they know the one true reality and that everything else is a lie. (kind of reminiscent of the intelligent design debate) The conspiracy theorists and the rationalists each find the other's views to be incoprehensible. 

If anything, researching conspiracy theory has taught me the fallacies of holding on to any one, objective reality, as being an absolute truth. A while ago I went, in a few days, from believing conspiracy theories were absurd, to being afraid that one of David Icke's reptoids was going to eat me, or something like that. I still think Icke's theories are brilliant, in the way they incorporate so many other theories and religions into one grand conspiracy, but I think of it more as a novel now than as an absolute truth.

Maybe instead of immediately denouncing any conspiracy theory, or anti-conspiracy-theory as being unobjective and a lie (especially for the 9/11 theories, of which I seem to change my mind every few days), we could simply cite the evidence, and look at it from a real objective, distanced viewpoint."

"Yes, _incredibly_ hard, I will explain why below, but first I'd like to point out that electricity from a gas station doesn't help solve the problem because the problem here is finding cheap energy, not deciding which form we should turn it into once we have it. I brought up the chicken/egg problem with building the necessary infrastructure because you seemed to think central planning will likely be unnecessary.

But onto how ""incredibly simple"" a charging station at every gas station would be: My 2liter 4-cylinder non-turbo car engine is 130Kw, to put that into perspective a heater (on full) draws about 2Kw and over a year a home averages about 0.5Kw. When I floor it, I am consuming enough power to run 260 houses, this is a small car, especially by American standards.

Now granted, the car is only 130Kw when I floor it, but at a gas station I don't want to wait 3 days for the car to be charged enough to run 7 days. Petrol contains 8.9Kwh/liter, so assuming I want to only wait 10 minutes for the equivalent of a 40 liter tank (10 gallons of gas), that's a 2.1 megawatt source of power the petrol station requires, alongside 2.1 megawatt cabling.

But I don't want to wait an hour for the 6 cars ahead of me to charge, the petrol station should have at least 5 pumps, meaning a 10 megawatt power feed.

Moreover, we have to install this infrastructure in every gas station (or perhaps every 10th station to begin with), and then somehow get that kind of power to them - every gas station in the country is now consuming the equivalent of 7,000 homes (21,000 homes if demand is round the clock).

Now I hear America already has trouble producing enough electricity.

There are also more subtle problems, peak oil will cause a permanent oil shock, the spike (which isn't really a spike, because it won't be coming down) will likely force the economy into recession and with oil initially costing nearly 10 times what it does today (a figure lots of people seem to bandy around, but perhaps it wont be that bad), building new infrastructure becomes prohibitively expensive.

So really, we need to be laying out the alternative fuel infrastructure _now_ while we still have some cheap oil to build it with.

(And I say ""now"" because when America has to dip into the strategic reserve in order to avoid oil shocks because _global_ production can't manage anymore when a few oil rigs in the gulf coast go offline from a hurricane - you know peak oil is right around the corner)"

"The thrash is kept in a pocket or similar size enclosure. When the user of the thrash decides to unleash it from its confines, the user is performing the action: ""take out the thrash"""
"hmm, thought I should clarify peak oil since you're talking about when the oil will run out, but the oil runing out is not the problem, and my post won't make sense if you think that's what I mean.

The reason oil is important isn't because our cars run on it (they only account for 20% of it), but because our economy runs on it (the other 80%). In the past, whenever we have grown the economy we have just pumped a little more oil each day to supply it. Peek oil is when we've reached the fastest that we can pump oil, and any economy that wants to grow has to either find another source of cheap energy, or take oil out of someone else's economy. To make matters worse, after peek oil the speed at which we can pump it will start to decline, furthering the gap between supply and demand.

Imagine 50 people in the desert find a tap of water, eventually they figure out the flow is only enough water to keep 47 of them alive - so if they split it evenly they'd all eventually die of thirst. There's plenty of water coming out of the tap (it certainly hasn't run out), just not enough for 50 people. So rather than split it evenly and all die they decide to apply a market model to it. The water was dirt cheap when there was enough (like oil is now), but once there isn't enough (and it's only a tiny fraction not enough), nobody wants to be one of the 3 people that will die, and so they all bid everything they can spare for something that used to cost so little, yet the water isn't anywhere near running out."

&gt; Landing at Kai Tak could be both challenging and spectacular. Depending on the landing direction, the aircraft might need to pass over densely populated areas in Kowloon at low altitude. At the northern end of the runway, buildings up to 6 storeys tall rose just across the road. The other three sides of the runway were surrounded by the harbour. Aircraft were literally landing in the harbour within the city; some passengers claimed they could even see the flicker of televisions through apartment windows as they landed."

"I gave this one points (because I find the subject very interesting and think others should think about it as well), but I think the author, and perhaps the professor interviewed paint an incomplete picture of the challenges of learning Chinese. 

First, it is *very* important to note that ""Chinese"" is at best an incomplete definition of the languages currently spoken in the people's republic of china and by the diaspora of Han Chinese around the world. Even the separation into Mandarin (Putonghua) and Cantonese (Guangdonghua) doesn't do justice to the variety of spoken Chinese throughout China. 
Whereas Mandarin is the official language of China, based largely on the local language in Beijing, the capitol, Cantonese is spoken in Hong Kong and Guangdong province and traditionally has been the language of the Chinese diaspora, due to the importance of the South-east of China in international trade. That said, there are many different local variants of Chinese, which when spoken are mutually unintelligible. Useful comparisons to the structure of the Chinese languages can be drawn from the relation of the Romance languages (Italian, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Romanian, Occitan, etc.) to Latin. [All of these languages share some degree of mutual intelligibility] Another is the case of Arabic, where there are many varieties of spoken Arabic (Iraqi, Morrocan, Egyptian, Syrian, etc.) and literary Arabic, which is common throughout, based on the qur'anic version of Arabic. 

That said, Chinese, like any language is very easy for children to learn how to speak. It is, nonetheless, a difficult writing system to master, even for chinese-born native speakers. [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0824810686] 
For adult foreigners, however, it poses a bit more of a challenge. 
The article points out that writing and tonality are the two main hurdles to overcome. 
I generally agree, however, there are a number of phonemes ( sounds) which simply do not occur in English (insert your local language here), which to occur in Chinese. These pose a challenge as well. 
Tonality is either a huge problem (my father is tone-deaf;I don't believe he could ever become fluent in Chinese) or just takes a lot of discipline/practice (remembering the mapping between sound/tone combinations and meaning; Fortunately context, aids in this process)
The writing system is not so bad, though it requires *a lot* of practice to maintain one's skill. To my surprise, I find it is more similar to Western writing systems, than I ever would have suspected. (In the process of this discovery, I feel I have learned very much about the relation between written and spoken language)
Finally, I find the comment by Dr. Weightman on Grammar at the end particularly misleading. Chinese grammar seems transparent to English speakers, particularly those who have studied a language where modifiers are tacked on to the end of words, to modify tense, declension, etc. (read: Finnish) This is due to the lack of inflection in Chinese - that is changes in word order lead to changes in meaning.

I am not too far along in my study of Chinese language, but I find the difficulty is often over-sold. (except to the tone-deaf, who should never try to learn tonal languages) That's not to say that it is a piece of cake. There are some mental hurdles - tonality, bizzare sounds, a different writing paradigm, and an unfamiliar approach to grammar. Once those are managable at a basic level, I find that dilligence and practice are all that are required.

"I know what Erlang can and can't do to some degree - I have had the good fortune of working with it professionally (and even contributed a tiny, tiny patch that makes it start up a bit faster).

But Bush's opponents know that there's not enough of a case in that. The wiretapping, OTOH, is not only a blatantly illegal and unconstitutional act -- it's one that Bush has fully admitted to and shown absolutely no remorse or regret for. If anything will bring him down, that will be it.

"This argument is just the ""both languages are turing complete, and hence equal"" argument in new clothes.  That C is the implementation language of erlang is a trivial detail-were erlang implemented in assembler, or C++, or haskell, it would not matter, modulo bugs in the implementation.  
C does scale, but the fact that erlang is written in C does not mean that C scales as well as erlang."

I'd love to have such trust placed in myself at work, but my company doesn't sit at the top end of the bell curve in our market segment as Google and this company do.  Where I work it is a daily grind, with pressure from the competition for a product that is not nearly so demonstrably critical.  When paying a little less for a product that might not have all the bells and whistles is a viable option, suddenly you can't empower the employees - the capatilist system means that you are going to have to screw your employees at some stage (a process which starts with skimping on training and ends in Christmas layoffs, vanishing pension plans, etc.)

Well, the US became a major economic player early in the 20th century.  But it wasn't until after WWII that it began to ""dominate"" the world economy.

""The Great Depression, with its preceding inflation from 1921 to 1929...""

Inflation was extremely low during that period, with several years of outright deflation.

""It did not enforce the direct payment of taxes like all of its predecessor empires did, but distributed instead its own fiat currency, the U.S. Dollar, to other nations in exchange for goods""

That's not typically how it works.  The US exchanges it's own fiat (actually fiat+fiduciary) dollar to other nations in exchange for their currency (typically, also fiat+fiduciary), which is then exchanged for foriegn goods (and vice versa).

""The increase in dollar holdings of foreigners via persistent U.S. trade deficits..""

Yeah, that happened.  In the 1980s.  What's this doing in a paragraph talking about Lyndon Johnson?

""When in 1970-1971 foreigners demanded payment for their dollars in gold, The U.S. Government defaulted on its payment on August 15, 1971. While the popular spin told the story of âsevering the link between the dollar and goldâ, in reality the denial to pay back in gold was an act of bankruptcy by the U.S. Government. Essentially, the U.S. declared itself an Empire. It had extracted an enormous amount of economic goods from the rest of the world, with no intention or ability to return those goods...""

This is exactly backwards.  The US ran significant trade *surpluses* during that period.  In other words, the world extracted an enormous amount of economic goods from the US - in exchange for promises to pay us back with their goods and services later, at interest (aka - debt).  Inflating the currency at that point would have no effect on debts denominated in other currencies, and would actually reduce the return to american holders of foreign debt denominated in dollars.

Too tired to go on.  Here's a hint about economics - if someone starts talking about gold, they're most likely a nut."

What Has Government Done to Our Money?
Murray Rothbard

The American dollar is worth nothing.  It has no intrinsic value outside of the paper and ink.  The value of a fiat currency is 100% based on the reputation of the issuing government.  Remember, this is a VERY short experiment.  35 years since the gold window was closed, and inflation has been absolutely astronomical.  It is all related to the increase in dollars being manufactuered by the US Government.  The entire world has had to bend over and take it.  They have had to sit back while the USA waggled its finger at them and made them behave.  The majority has been forced to sit idly by as the USG planted military installations across the globe, and stomped anybody's dick in the dirt that got frisky.

Can a global switch to a Euro for oil system virtually cripple the USG?  Yes.  Yes it can.

The Euro is essentially a piece of shit too, just like all the other fiat currency on the planet.  Nothing to back it up except political bullshit and endless streams of rhetoric.  It is a failed experiment, but unfortunately one that is extrememly popular to the political class.  For obvious reasons."
"And any statement followed by calling people names represents a poorly worded fallacy.

Fiat money is a politician's best friend.  Period.  Who trusts the average politician to print all the money they want with no accountability?  Apparently, by your logic, only somebody that is insane would question this practice.

Erlang makes it very easy to optimize for the special case.  Often a simple solution is best.

factorial(Acc, 50) -&gt; Acc*30414093201...512000000000000;

"Other elevators have used learning algorithims before, but I think their real breakthrough is the fact that they are gathering the most important information before people get on -- their destination.  It seems so obvious, yet it isn't.  Find out where people are going before they get in, so they can be grouped appropriately.

Even in a small building, it seems as if it would help.  Think about this situation:  It's the end of lunchtime in an office building, and a group of 10 coworkers returns, all wanting to go to the 8th floor.  Five others arrive as well, wanting to go to various lower floors.  If the system had their destinations ahead of time, it could direct the 10 people to one elevator, and everyone else to another one, so that the group of 10 wouldn't have to wait for all the other stops.  The 10 people would arrive at their destinations sooner.

"From what I read, I suspect two drawing factors:  1) super lightweight threading/coroutines and 2) aesthetic factors.  With regards to 1), I'm not enough of a language junkie to properly appreciate that, although I did read and enjoy some of the tutorials on continuationss (and how that could be the next big thing in web development).  With regards to 2), well, I like how Ruby looks myself, but I can see people enjoying writing code in this language.  I see some patterns that make me think of JavaScript, which is also a prototype based language, so there's a possible vector for adopters.

But where I'm with you is that the io page does a poor job of articulating what it's strengths are.  That, unfortunately, seems to be characteristic of many languages that have come to the fore in recent years. Ruby is one excellent example.  I hope that there's some articulate io developer who could talk about it."
"Heh, no kidding. Ruby has only gotten big in the least year due to Rails.

Just about the only way it would be the ""next Ruby"" is if it had some killer app which really caught people's eyes. Don't get me wrong, Ruby is an excellent language and I use it over anything else, but the main uniqueness of Ruby was how much its killer app bumped it over many other languages in the public eye. Other languages are very similar to Ruby in other ways.

The main problem I have from Io right now just glancing at it, is I don't think there are many books written on it. Programming languages can be complicated things, and unless the language is well documented (I think part of that is having several books that the public can go out and pick up in order to learn the language), its not only hard to get people knowing about a language, but its also hard to get them to learn it. I personally can't sit before a PC screen for hours at a time reading. Books are no problem."

""Beautiful language"" is a hard thing to sell to other programmers if they never had that kind of choice to make.  If Ruby instead made claims like ""Write this robust algorithm in 30% fewer lines (compared to  foo), and is more readable"", maybe that would have gotten more devs to at least look at it.  Disclaimer: I am not a marketer, although I work in a marketing department

At any rate, I'm sure we all agree that the best marketing vehicle Ruby ever had was Rails.  I suspect Rails also set the bar pretty high for evaluating new languages from this point on. :)  Which is just fine by me."

"It would be very difficult to attempt to learn Chinese using only Pinyin.  It is much easier to learn the whole language, characters included.  This is because the characters hold the core ideas of the language.  Most characters have several different pronunciations so the characters become an important mnemonic tool for learning to speak and listen.  Knowledge of the characters is critical for understanding jokes and other subtleties of the language.

To really learn a language, you must learn to think in that language.  The characters engage the visual part of your brain in the learning and thinking process.  The process of learning to communicate in another language involves conversation, reading, writing, and countless hours learning the culture (spending time with native speakers).

"I'm a member of the [Internet Hosting Cooperative](http://hcoop.net/).  We rent a dedicated server from [InterServer](http://interserver.net/) for about $150/mo.  InterServer has not been as reliable as hoped: we've experienced inexplicable reboots and network problems every couple of weeks.  For example, this morning our machine was offline for about 10 minutes because a router in the InterServer datacenter failed.

We're looking for a better host.  We can certainly afford better, with 53 users splitting the bill evenly."

"I'm not that enthusiastic about the way this is being presented. The question was not ""Should Congress impeach Bush?"", it was ""Should Congress *consider* impeachment?"".

The second sounds much more reasonable than the first, and it's incorrect to presume the percentage agreement with the second is the same as with the first.

(After all, if they're reasonable, they should *consider* everything, shouldn't they?)"

"The main problem is, like you said, the question is ""should impeachment be considered"". So roughly 1/2 of all Americans think it should be thought about, but its no where near the 75% needed to actually do it (it is 3/4ths vote in the House and then a 3/4ths vote in the Senate for impeachment, correct?).

So judging from this poll, unless Bush does something absolutely ridiculous over the next 3 years (which is very possible), he will never be impeached."
"Paul,

To what extent do you think you've followed your own advice? Obvious you love essay writing and working on Arc, and I'm guessing that you're enjoying YC. But what about, say, writing ANSI CL and On Lisp?  Were those written mostly for love, or primarily for money/prestige?

I'm most curious about Viaweb. In another of your essays you wrote advice that seems to contradict most of what you wrote in this one: ""Where there's muck, there's brass"". I can't find the reference, but I also remember a comment that most successful startups are founded by people who are grossly overqualified for the technical challenges (and thus presumably would rather work on more interesting problems, ceteris paribus).

You've also emphasized on a number of occasions that starting a startup requires you to work much harder than you would in any other context. Of course, 'hard' and 'fun' aren't mutually exclusive: I just got back from the MIT Mystery Hunt where for two days I worked harder than just about any other time in my life, and it was also among the most fun things I've ever done. But, would you have worked as hard as you did at Viaweb even if it wouldn't have helped your chances of succeeding? If today you still had the health you did as a grad student, would you be inclined to do it again?"

Even if someone else wrote something more interesting, Paul Graham has a bigger following and therefore his essays are of interest to more people. Therefore, it follows that they ought to score higher."
"True. But, I bet you'd find that people would still be reluctant to actually unseat the President, as opposed to doing so in a thought experiment. 

The dodgier part comes later. Everyone wants to hold someone accountable if they did something wrong. Just like everyone wants to support the President in a time of war.

No apologies/shame from their side. No sirree! They built shrines in honour of rapists and murderers, and pray to them daily. It's been compared to the Germans building a temple in honour of Hitler in the middle of Berlin, and lighting a candle to his memory each day.

"'If Ruby instead made claims like ""Write this robust algorithm in 30% fewer lines (compared to foo), and is more readable"", maybe that would have gotten more devs to at least look at it.'

Indeed, that is the course taken by the Rails developers, and the specific claims of improved productivity has attracted many followers.  The down side here is that, judging by comments on the Rails dev list, large numbers of these cabooses see Ruby/Rails not as a better general-purpose language, but as a better 'script my Web app with little deep though' tool.  

It remains to be seen how many will progress to learning and appreciating Ruby on its own, or will instead continue to seek out the next ready-made plugin or engine that will solve whatever is their current problem.

On the other hand, I am *so* sick of the default Blogger templates. It should be criminal to launch a community site that large without some measure of forced customization in the template.

"It's a brilliant idea, but the challenge is entirely in figuring out how to present it to the users in a meaningful way... and most importantly how to correct for stupid humans screwing it up. (ie, getting on the wrong elevator)

The initial implementation should almost have a conductor, at least on the ground floor. Instead of fighting a kiosk, you simply tell the attendant that you want 4th floor, and then he indicates which elevator to wait for.

Alternately, you could scrap the kiosk, and instead just have all the floor buttons on the wall. Once you push a floor button, that *floor number* appears above the door of the elevator that will make the next trip there."

If a condominium complex with 20 floors previously had 6 elevators, now it can run on 4, which means an extra 200 square feet of space *per floor*. (Assuming a 10'x10' shaft, including the noise padding, etc.) That ought to make any developer perk up..."

I did some hard work at Viaweb that probably wasn't necessary.  Some of the code I wrote had tricks in it that I wrote just to please myself.

"Maybe because it solves problems you did not face before, so your selective mind just did not notice the related keywords.


For example, it has a massive advantage over ruby/python, it is damn simple to embed and it is very small. One of the main inspiration for Io is Lua, which is somewhat becoming the de facto standard as an extension language (think world of warcraft). 
And it has a somewhat big advantage over most languages by providing actor based concurrency, which is really simple to reason about and is a great boost over dumb shared state concurrency a-la pthread/javathreads.

But most importantly, Io provides macro support, which means you can morph it into whatever language you want but still retain the advantages of the platform, and avoiding a s-exp based environment (which may be considered a bad thing :).

So, I think Io may mostly appeal, at first sight, to people that already hit some wall while working with other similar languages.

At one point, you mention that any job no one really wants to do will go away, much like servants for the rich have mostly dissapeared.  I have a question and a statement for you:

2) What makes you feel that servants for the rich are gone?  It seems to me that the job has just been a bit more delgated.  Most of the rich people I know personally, people that 100 years ago would have had servants, now have a personal assistant, a maid, a cook, a masage therapist, a haridresser, etc., all of which come to their house to do things for them."

I'm glad you avoided the old saw: ""Do what you love and the money will follow"".  I really can't stand that saying, it implies that doing what you love automatically leads to imense riches.  It's a very American kind of saying: highly optimistic but not backed by any sort of empirical reality.  Recently I've been hearing ""Do what you love and the money won't matter so much""; that seems to be make a lot more sense  (and the flavor of this essay seems to agree with that modified version)."

"More than likely, a fair portion of the ""agree"" respondents to the poll were thinking about sending a message rather than actually wanting to see Bush impeached.  I think that most of the people who hate Bush wouldn't support an impeachment over this if it came down to actually doing it.  

Bush had the fortune of coming in after Clinton, who burned out a lot of people on Presidential scandals.  At this point people just expect anything having to do with Bush to be like this situation.  We're in the midst of a period of lowered expectations.  Hopefully we're at or past the middle of it, and not at the beginning.

So he'll get away with it.  It may have weakened him, but only with a few people that are interested and who had tentatively supported him before.  Everyone else is either apathetic or has chosen their side and will stick with it, regardless.  The Jihadis are unswayed and the cynics are yawning.

You can access the AST in Io (and I've had need to do that in Ruby, but you have to resort to ripper or ParseTree which are a bit hackish), multiple VMs can run in the same application, and the actor-based concurrency model sounds interesting.  Oh, and Io apparently has macros.

There are no Io books.   But some people think of that as a challenge.

At this point, I want to learn Io because it looks kind'a fun; the same reason I learned Ruby several years ago.  Keep an eye on the early adopters: they just might be finding the next Ruby.  It might take 5 years or so for it to show up on most radar screens, though."

effective text editing? in vim?
I wouldn't pay $29 to use reddit if the only other people on the site were the kind of people that paid $29 to use reddit.
The rapid turnarounds in agile software development projects make developing a usable UI challenging.  This article offers some possible ways of dealing with this.

well i'm glad to hear that your real toddler takes precedence... Maybe you can teach him/her to program it :)
"Useless since it only captures ""discretionary"" spending.  Saying congress has no control of entitlements is like saying I can't control my mortgage (by buying a differnt house) or heating costs (by turning down the thermostat).  This half-truth is also being touted by ice cream mogul Ben Cohen.  If you don't want to tell the whole story, it's just PROPOGANDA."
"Indeed.

Web 2.0 for me means constant down time for sites built on unstable but ""cool"" tech. I live in Australia, and due to my prime time being the small hours, often my ""web 2.0"" apps that I use regularly are not working.

Here is the dirty laundry list:

* Reddit (actually no, its quite reliable now)
* Google reader (less so GMail)
* Backpack (37 signals) - either down or very very slow
* del.icio.us - often down. Its terrible."
uh... voting?  getting involved in campaigns?  writing or calling your congressmen?

I remember this from Futurama.
Would have been nice if the article explained exactly *what* was changing...
"When Leno asks some college students where Italy is, and the reply is ""Uh, is that the country next to Europe?"", you might argue that knowing Italy to lie *in* Europe would be minimum amount of knowledge among college students.

But hey, I'm neither american or live in the US, but north America is a HUGE place. So it's understandable that you know less about the rest of the world when you have so much domestically.

Americans aren't stupid, they just tend to be like a bull in a china shop sometimes..."

"Great article to read considering this has been a problem since about
'97. Google loves those cookies on your machine as all of them are set
to expire in 2035.  Meaning if you dont scrub them your ip address, cookie id &amp; searches are quietly stored away for later use.  This is the minefield waiting too explode.

This problem exists on every site that collects &amp; stores information. So Reddit. 

*Where can I read your privacy policy?

*Whats your privacy policy wrt keeping searches?  

*Do you encrypt search information or is it plain text?

*Is user data scrubbed when you stop using your account?

*Is it kept on disc ready for any government agency to request? 

*Do you track individual users through the site (great for advertising)?

This link is old.  Has everyone not seen this?
"Are you kidding? Do you know how much cognitive power it takes to play some video games today? Learning how to play a modern Real Time Strategy competitively online is more intellectually demanding than the vast majority of any other activities performed by anyone.

Yes, there is danger of wasting time. But I would much, much rather my kids play video games than, say, watch TV.

Plus, what better way to get your kids interested in technology than games? I bet most people who are in technology started because they loved video games."
Vote it down and it disappears. What's it to you?
so somebody links from reddit to their blog where they threaten suicide and reddit should shut down?
"I had a couple brief back-and-forths with this guy in kuro5hin when I used to post there, thought he was a bit of a nutter. Then again, most people who post on the net a lot are a little bit nuts. Still, you usually don't hear about one of those people killing themselves. One part creepy, two parts sad.

Excellent book that should be read by anyone interested in politically-incorrect views of economics.
"Read the YCombinator [FAQ](http://ycombinator.com/faq.html). Some highlights:

* YCombinator's investment is usually $6000 per founder
* Valuations are in the 'low to mid hundreds of thousands'
* YCombinator usually gets a 5-7% stake in the company"
Loud maybe... but not dumb ;-)
"I'd be interested to know what group most people think of when they hear the phrase ""partisan loudmouths"". I'd guess people think of the political party they oppose, though the article points out the effect is irrespective of political party. (It doesn't look like they restricted the study to loudmouths, either, unless I missed something.) 

Personally, I think of just about everyone involved in politics."

"Well, there's one exception -- if the issue is solely money and nothing else, and if money pressures are forcing you to leave, then go ahead and take the counter-offer.  Otherwise, he's spot on the mark."
"Here's a nice one: Albanian gangsters selling babies to folks in Western Europe. A terribly cruel trade in humans and prostitutes, for big money:

http://www.balkanpeace.org/hed/archive/july00/hed361.shtml

When you look at the misery these folks create, it is hard to imagine how you could fight the crime and ever be accused of being ""too hard"" on such amoral scum. And to think there's a huge number of them, all working together, to keep the criminal conspiracy going.

This is the sort of situation that makes you think we'd all be better off if the Albanians moved to ""Planet Albania"", and we just remained here in this world."

"I have noticed also that articles that present a counterpoint to left wing, anti-capitalist, anti-Bush, anti-Religious, anti-Google, anit-Iraq War opinion also get modded down mercilessly. Of course I understand why, but I worry that in the end Reddit will only offer a single point of view on anything. 

Diversity of opinion is important for thinking minds, maybe reddit could have some kind of ""bottom"" page with the most down rated articles. WIth some way to weed out spammers of course."

"I find his ""I am a mathematician"" approach kind of annoying. IMO, his analogy between learning a new programming language and a new mathematical field is wrong on so many levels. Judging from an earlier post he made today he's still stuck on intro problems in Baby Rudin (introductory real analysis book, used for freshman honours courses at good schools), so I don't think he has the experience yet to accurately make such analogies."
