I just really need someone,Still up bud?
I can't enjoy drawing anymore. Drawing was all I had to my happiness.,Makes alot of sense. Definitely understand the feeling. I think most depressed people crave creative ability because we just feel so many emotions and it really does help. I have a creative side but for music and Everytime I don't write or don't sing and just blow it off or people say my dream is stupid just makes me feel so ruined and empty.
Nostalgia feels so good but hurts so much ....,Can always create new nostalgia
Nostalgia feels so good but hurts so much ....,I disagree. Nostalgia for me is always a motivator to restrore the old me and the good old time this old me had.
I can't enjoy drawing anymore. Drawing was all I had to my happiness.,"You know, I was like this at some point.

I also stopped drawing for almost the same reasons but eventually I found myself joining some clubs and figuring out the type of styles I liked and wanted to learn.

Joining communities like DeviantArt, Instagram, or even some video-games may make you feel included and will make you do your best when drawing. Eventually people will start commenting and giving input on your stuff.

It may not work for everyone but it definitely made an impact on my work!"
Ever feel like you‚Äôre just not compatible with the life you‚Äôre living?,Elaborate
"If you could go back in time and change one major mistake, what would you choose?","Thats an interessting question, we all want importance and meaning (atleast most of us) if you ask me i would love to travel space in the far future, since i allways was a space and scifi nerd. :D

Hey atleast we can witness all the steps that will lead up to that, technology in itself is fascinating."
"If you could go back in time and change one major mistake, what would you choose?","I like OP‚Äôs answer and would put it in my top 5, but my #1 would be the high school I chose. I wish I went to a closer high school nearby that was co-Ed and make an attempt to make friends, instead of going to a 1.5 hour away, all guys school, and not attempting to make friends."
Ever feel like you‚Äôre just not compatible with the life you‚Äôre living?,"I think I know what you mean. I never feel like I belong anywhere. I see other people interact and its like watching a movie. It rarely feels natural for me. I feel like I just making people feel awkward. I think someone else could be a better me than whatever I'm doing. I see the opportunities in life to improve, but I got too many mental blocks."
Its my birthday,Happy cake day!
Nostalgia feels so good but hurts so much ....,I feel that. Stay strong.

Therapist recommended me trying an antidepressant but that terrifies me,I have been on Zoloft and it‚Äôs helped a lot! Just start at the lowest dose possible for a few months.
Therapist recommended me trying an antidepressant but that terrifies me,"I‚Äôve been on luvox and prozac for depression and ocd, and it has helped a lot, it literally saved my life. 
Just express this concerns to your doc and evaluate your personal situation"
Therapist recommended me trying an antidepressant but that terrifies me,I‚Äôm on Effexor rn and I‚Äôve been on meds since I was 16. It‚Äôs helped a lot and I haven‚Äôt got to the point where I was suicidal again so that‚Äôs good.
anyone wanna talk?,"Same, I can talk for a bit if you want."
Therapist recommended me trying an antidepressant but that terrifies me,"Honestly, I am on Zoloft and I've noticed no real change in my behavior or how I feel besides crying less and not being upset all the time lol."
Nostalgia feels so good but hurts so much ....,"For sure, I get it all the time. However I see it as a happy sadness. I'm happy to feel nostalgia because, although it makes me sad those great times have past, it means what I experienced happened. Like you were suppose to be there at that point in time."
Therapist recommended me trying an antidepressant but that terrifies me,"From my personal experience, therapy alone helps, antidepressants alone help (if you indeed need them). But nothing works so well as the two combined.

I started with Sertraline and it was alright. Very few and mild side effects during the first week and then nothing.
The problem is that I kept relapsing. Then I changed to Venlafaxine. It's working really well and no side effects, except when I forget to take them... then I get heavy headaches and nausea. But overall it's been really great. 

The thing is, antidepressants have evolved a lot but still get a bad reputation. There are many options now. Also, how well it works and the side effects varies from person to person.

I think it's worth a shot. If you don't feel comfortable, you should try talking to a doctor and ask as many questions as you need."
Welcome,Same
Welcome,Everyday
I just really need someone,"I had a really bad day today (fight with my dad) nothing productive helped, even my medication didn‚Äôt do anything to mask the numbing feeling that takes over everything.. I face timed my boyfriend whose in another state to drink a few beers over it to make myself feel a bit better when all a sudden I heard thee entire call was his friends in the background telling me to get over it and deal with it in sassy voices mocking me to thee cruelest words. These people I thought were my friends as well and I soon discovered they actually mock me any time I call, listening to the thanks of my boyfriend. No matter what I say. Negative or positive. A one year long relationship and a 6 month long self harm sobriety now gone. I‚Äôm sorry your alone and hope that we can connect."

Welcome,It‚Äôs my first thought when I wake up.
"Every time I try to revel in something positive going on, I end up talking myself back down.","Your dad sounds like he's pissed off that he hasn't had the opportunity to travel more himself, and he's taking it out on you by being negative about your aspirations.

So, who has these expectations for you?"
I am on my own.,"I‚Äôm at college 500 miles away from home. I spend most of my time in my dorm room, and my roommate is usually in here doing nothing aswell. I‚Äôm part of a club sports team because I need to be a part of something and get exercise. It sucks really bad not having my own space."

"Sooo When your depression goes on for years, and people ask how you are, do you lie?","yeah I lie all the time. I try to think of it more as not burdening other people with my shit. for people who you‚Äôre closer with, try to think of something that‚Äôs especially hard at that point, and tell them that you‚Äôre struggling with it. that way you can be honest and not always have the same answer, cause (at least for me) that feels super awkward"
anyone wanna talk?,"I can't really sleep either so might as well, but warning, this will probably be a wall of text.

I really wish I could just stop existing. No warning, no feeling, nothing. I wish I could close my eyes and everything that is me would just cease to be. I've drifted in and out of this mindset for a few years now, and the only reason I'm not dead already is because the times I actually tried failed because of hesitation. I'm afraid of death. I'm afraid what comes after because I don't know what comes after. I hate nearly everything about my own life but for all I know hell is real and I'll be suffering for eternity because I'm a terrible person. But at the same time I don't want to live, because everything I've learned and continue to learn about tells me that life *fucking sucks* for most people. Some people think life is beautiful because there are moments that make it worth everything else, and while I have had moments like those before I don't think they are worth everything else I experience. 

Sorry for the wall but I've been unemployed for a year now and after the bazillionth time I've been ghosted by a place that I thought I had a good chance at getting into, after the 10th time this month my mother storms out of the house drunk with her boyfriend chasing after her and doesn't come back for an hour while I put my siblings to bed and clean up after our fifth night of boxed macaroni, after the third time this week my baby sister gets in bed telling me she's still hungry because we barely had enough macaroni to feed everyone and I know I can't actually do anything to help her besides tell her we're going to the store soon because I can't get a fucking minimum wage job, everything seems just a bit bleaker."
I hate school...but wait theres more,"Tell me what happened with this other person ? if it helps you feel better im on the same boat.

im all ears man, tell me about you"
Its my birthday,Happy birthday.
Therapist recommended me trying an antidepressant but that terrifies me,"I was beyond terrified to try Zoloft for that reason. I‚Äôm about 7 weeks into taking Zoloft and the past couple weeks I‚Äôve noticed I feel much better. I was prescribed 25mg and for the first week I only took half a tablet because I was scared of side effects. The only side effects I got at first was feeling a bit off and gross, but those went away quickly. I would definitely recommend you try it out, I‚Äôm so glad I did. If you do decide to try an antidepressant, your depression/anxiety may get worse before it gets better, but if you start having an increase of suicidal thoughts taper off immediately. Definitely start off the first week by taking half of your prescription and just be mindful about what you‚Äôre feeling and you‚Äôll be alright. Only side effect I have now that I‚Äôm settled into it is I get drunk way easier but honestly I‚Äôm not mad about it."
Its my birthday,happy birthday
I wish I really knew how to explain how I feel,"You don't have to explain it because most people here reading this will already know. That's depression, man, in a nutshell. Feeling worthless, not wanting to be alive but not wanting to die, and just feeling nothing at all. Depression is the most fucked up thing I have encountered in life. I'm sorry you are having to deal with it, nobody should have to feel like this, ever.

Can I just make a few observations? If I overstep, please ignore what I write or just tell me to fuck off, I promise it won't hurt my feelings, but I see some things that maybe you haven't seen yourself?

First, it appears you're numb because you want to be. No judgment, just observing, but if you're wondering if there's a path forward, this might be worth thinking about. In your first paragraph you explicitly state that you push aside the pain. It sounds as though you've been successful. Think of it instead as a physical injury, like a huge gash down your leg. You can inject it with Novocaine and then the pain will be gone and you can then ignore it, but the gash is still there; it's not going to heal until you deal with the actual injury. Pain tells our body something is wrong. Emotional pain isn't any different. If you just refuse to acknowledge it, i.e. slap some emotional Novocaine on it, then the problem doesn't go away, it's just ignored. Could this be where you're at? You're numb because it's easier than trying to heal? Again, tell me to fuck off, please, if I'm going places I don't belong, but you did post here and actively asked if it was worth trying to feel again. I'd say it is. But, in that case, it seems like you have one more pretty deep emotional injuries you're going to have to confront when the band-aid is ripped off. Whatever it is that's causing so much pain that you buried it instead of faced it, you'll have to find a way to forgive yourself so you can move forward. Only you know if that's worth doing, but for the sake of children, again I'd say it's worth a try. If you fail and fuck things up, are you any worse off than you are now? Only you can really answer these things, but like you, I'm alive because of the two people who would be devastated by my loss: my children.

Which is my second observation. You clearly love your children. Grab on to that as the rope to pull out of the darkness. I held a Glock 19 to my head more than once. My kids are why I didn't pull the trigger, and my kids are the reason I didn't give up. I failed at a lot of things as a father, but my kids always know that I love them. You sound similar. Love for and from children is powerful, man. Use it. Fuck all the macho bullshit that society says men---I'm assuming you're a man, if not I apologize---should abide by. Make sure your kids know that you love them. It sounds as if they probably already do. You mention a lot of battles and a lot of defeats. The mere fact that you're still fighting says a lot about you. The fight isn't over until you give up, and you clearly have not given up, or else why would you post here? You *feel* like giving up, that's depression, but it's obvious you don't want to. So from one person fucked up by depression to another: don't give up. More than anything, it's about this. Deal with each day one at a time, do the best you can for that day, and move on to the next one. It's how I survive.

Finally, it looks like you've already decided that surviving, at least for a while---""just long enough to see my kids grow up""---is what you'll be doing for a while. So, let's say survival lasts another five years, hypothetically. That can either be five years of at least trying to make things better, or five years of ceding victory to depression. Which is the question you're asking, right? Should you ""even bother trying to regain the ability to feel things"". Seems to me like the answer to that is a resounding yes. You've already decided you're going to be around for a while, so why the fuck not at least try to make however long that while is be the best it can be. It could lead down a path that lets you really live, and at the very worst, will you be any worse off for having tried?

None of these questions are rhetorical. As in, I'm not judging you with my own answers that I think are obvious---fuck knows I've made enough mistakes that I have zero right to judge anyone for anything---but rather I'm saying you should actually consider them as questions that needs answers from you. And when you do, they might help you find your way toward answering the question you came here to ask.

For what it's worth, man, I'm sorry you are in this fucked up place called depression. I've been struggling with it for about three years now and I wouldn't wish it on anyone, ever. I hope you find a way forward, you deserve it for no other reason than you are a decent human being, and you clearly love your children. I'm sorry you are suffering; you're not alone."

Nostalgia feels so good but hurts so much ....,i felt the with my soul

Nostalgia feels so good but hurts so much ....,"I can't even look back at old memories without crying. I yearn so much for those days back.

What‚Äôs next in my life?,Don't compare yourself to your friends. They are probably piling up ridiculous debt and not all of them know what they want to do either.
essay?,What is your essay about
I hate school...but wait theres more,"You sir, are just as a real man as I am a sarcastic fuck wad. I can't say that I relate to all of you feelings, but that disgust, anxiety, ohh boy and regrets? You hit too close to home. I hear you and it's painful. Everyone in this sub is in it together. Yeah we both feel like our ""tiny"" school problems are negligible compared to other people. 

Oh other.people have it worse whatever. I get it. I'm there too. Im so jealous of the people who are happy. There are literal days where I don't say a single word. I just sit in silence and stare at the board. Of course no point in telling people this. And there's no point in letting them know. So I put up a persona. Let's be comedic! Funny! Joke around all the time! And hope. Hope for ONE person to catch on to what my jokes really are. My jokes are the truth about me. Comedy isn't good unless it's based on truth. I'm just hoping one day someone will figure it out. But of course no one will because who actually cares for me? No one. It's useless. Worthless. Sometimes I think about just running into a car and ending it. But I don't. No matter how shitty my life is, I am not going to let it be shitty for my parents and the people I care for. So I'm going to push through this. I'll be dead in class, but physically I'll be alive. No one can know who I really am. No one will understand. But here's to holding hope that one soul will be there for me in the end."
essay?,"When you‚Äôre writing, never reread a sentence. If you don‚Äôt know what to write, write ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what to say‚Äù and keep going. Also have you tried making concept maps before you begin writing? For me, that‚Äôs what keeps me calm when I‚Äôm writing. It‚Äôs an excellent way to organize your points (one paragraph per point). I know all too well how it‚Äôs like writing an essay last minute and I wish you luck."

essay?,"Yeah so what are you writing about exactly?

Have a topic, what are you exactly tackling here? 
It‚Äôll make it easier for you to know where to start off"
"Want to self-harm, I think...","Do not ever turn to self harming. If you feel the urge, get a pen and start drawing wherever you want to cut/burn. Trust me. Even when you get clean it is nearly impossible to stop thinking about it. Every day you have to be conscious about hiding the scars and there are days where you have to use up all your strength to not relapse. The best way to deal with your problems is to seek professional help."
"Want to self-harm, I think...","you can't just go and tell people ""i cut "" and show the scars, that's only going to get people thinking you're weird in a bad way and they're gonna pity you and talk a lot about it, i did it once but i didn't harm myself, my dog punched me and left me with bruises all over my arms, the next day, i put my sleeves up bc i thought it looked cool and as soon i entered the classroom all the kids started ""you harm yourself?"" ""your dad hits you?"" and a lot of bullshit, even a girl told me that it was a trend and she started to slightly cut her wrists. it was so strange"
Football might be killing me,"Then maybe stop playing football for a while, surround yourself in a different atmosphere of friends, try to ignore them and not to take what they seriously and stand up for yourself, try and talk to someone you trust, get help.."
What‚Äôs next in my life?,[deleted]
I... I like cutting myself.,I felt the same way. Cutting gave me a sort of thrill but all addictive things do that. Best way to stop is to do other things that release good chemicals such as watching comedy specials or going for a run when you get the urge.

You deserve to get the help you need. Admit yourself tonight if you can. You don‚Äôt have to feel like this."
I just really need someone,[deleted]
"Sooo When your depression goes on for years, and people ask how you are, do you lie?","‚ÄúHow are you‚Äù is just a greeting, I dont know why people here are taking it that seriously. No one really gives a shit how you feel even your friends."
I... I like cutting myself.,"Okay so I see the unwillingness to help yourself in the it is so much easier and I believe it is, but you know what is a lot harder to do then do a better coping mechanism. Going to the hospital because you cut to deep or too much and you are close to death. I don't want to be like those people that just tell you to stop because it is so much more than that to actually get someone to stop because when you are in a place so dark you know something is bad and you try to convince yourself not to do it. I was like that with alchohol just because of the fact that it was the only relief in my life from my typical feelings even after only drinking once I found myself unable to stop i formed a psychological need immediately although i would be perfectly fine if i went cold turkey my mind had no other way out of feeling like shit. And eventually after enough cutting and having people feel terrible for you, and having people beg you to stop because they CARE you may feel the need to hide and my feel quilty for it. Tell your friends your situation the ones that you know will respond in a compassionate way. When my dad confronted me with my drinking he just yelled at me with zero understanding about how i feel and he wonders why i don't talk to him, but trust me it isn't worth it stop as quickly as you can if you can't go cold turkey because it is hard even thou some may not understand some will. Have your friends keep in calling/texting distance and you just call/text them when ever you feel like you are going to do it then they should be able to help you get by the day, and it will get easier to by the time goes on."
I... I like cutting myself.,"For me it was making hidden pain visible painand real. I stopped doing it when I scarred up my chest so bad I can't really go swimming without staying neck deep in the water, and when therapy revealed the inner darkness enough that I could start identifying and striking back at it."
Nostalgia feels so good but hurts so much ....,I feel the exact same way. I listen to a lot of music from video games I grew up with (especially the Sims). Its so nice to have that nostalgia but it hurts in a way that can only hit you when you know the good ol days have passed. It sucks
Football might be killing me,"I think you should be proud of your successes and the sports life, at least, you've built for yourself. Are things externally well but internally falling apart? I kind of got that from the post. If so, this might be a chronic depression case. Have you been diagnosed with uneven brain chemistry from genetic chemical imbalance, or do you spend a lot of time mentally agreeing with and supporting thoughts of suicide or self-hatred instead of confronting and combatting them at every opportunity? And does your team really not like you, or is it you just don't hang out and so don't have a strong relationship with them?"
I don't know what to do anymore,"Welcome to both Reddit and the big r/D!

Does the BPD and anxiety have a specific root you can identify? I had a miserable case of Borderline mixed with suicidal depression and crippling social anxiety. It was founded in several rough childhood homes I grew up in, but sustained itself through my constant mental empowering of desiring death for myself and constantly considering how hopeless I was. But once I found these roots, it was just a matter of reorganizing my thinking through CBT and constant refocus to pull my attention away from my past, move far away, and proactively redirect my thoughts from self-destruction to confidence and grit until I was automatically supporting myself from within, rather than poisoning myself.

Hope you're doing better as you read this post."
essay?,"You may have gone to bed by now, which honestly is perfectly fine, but I had to share an observation: you can definitely write. You wrote a whole paragraph about not being able to write an essay. :D How and why? Probably because you were passionate about it. The paragraph you wrote here is full of honest feeling, you laid your emotions bare and just let the words fill the page. I pose that the problem you're facing is not that you can't write, because you very clearly can, but that you're being forced to write about something for which you have no passion.

And dude...I don't blame you. Canterbury Tales as it relates to courtly love? Really? Don't get me wrong, I'm a writer and love classic literature, and if the material were presented correctly then okay, maybe this is a decent essay topic, but did the teacher actually do that? Or did they simply assign the reading and then assign the essay? Did your teacher give you any fucking motivation at all? Because...courtly love? In the age of Instagram and Tinder, when high school students are often more worried about whose going to shoot them rather then instruct them? Courtly love is a romantic idea that almost certainly has a place in society, but where the fuck is it in modern times when parenting has been replaced by videos and games and social media? Fuck the original assignment and write about *that*. Ask as your thesis, ""Does courtly love even matter in our Tinder-Grindr-OkCupid world, and if it does, how does it compete?"" This is probably something you could get passionate about. And if you have a teacher worth anything at all, they'll appreciate you going outside the box.

On the other hand, it's late and you indicated that it's due tomorrow. I promise you that the importance you assign to this grade or even to high school in general is far less than you imagine and will evaporate before you're even out of your teens. You have the option of just saying fuck it and accepting the consequences, which I posit will be less than you are imagining.

But, yeah, don't try to demonstrate an inability to write with a passionate written paragraph. :D Yeah you used a great deal of poor grammar, but the idea you were communicating came through loud and clear: this assignment SUCKS and I'm not able to write a single word about it because it doesn't fucking matter. You can write. So, if you have another hour or two, find a way to turn this assignment into writing about something that *does* matter, or just forget it and decide to accept whatever happens. Either way it can't be any worse than the stress you're creating for yourself, which in two months or maybe two weeks or even two days, won't even matter.

For what it's worth, it sounds like a really crappy writing assignment. Which is why I say, make it better by approaching it from the perspective of something that makes it relevant to you, today.

Good luck man. I love writing and I love words, there is so much power in words, but I hate teachers that cause students to despise writing by giving them meaningless assignments."
"Want to self-harm, I think...","Self harm almost always doesn't make you look undesirable to be around and people who think that are usually dickwads who don't want to deal with other people and who lack empathy. Some people will think that it is attention seeking, and sometimes it is, but almost always if they are actual cuts not just scrapes like a pencil scratch. People that actually care will be concerned about you and those are the people that you need to keep remember to respect there boundaries thou. I remember one of my friends who thought she was gonna relapse on cutting so i tried to keep in touch as much a possible(mabye not the best idea hindsight because it was probably stressing her out, but no need to dwell in the past) anyways your friends will care and not think of you as a burden, and if they do or think in ways you think they will they ain't your friends and no need to pay attention to them as you don't need those people in your life. Unless you have some sort of proof that you are a bad person that you actually deserve it, but bad people don't usually care that they are bad people. They may think they deserve it, but they don't care to go and actually do something. If you want to hurt yourself to punish yourself you are already punishing yourself mabye not visibly and it may not feel lile it but internally you are putting yourself down. I know most of it isn't concious and really something you can control and be absent but if they come up don't necessarily fight it just acknowledge it's existence, and mabye give the intrusive thoughts and feelings like that a name I named my Richard because dick is short for Richard and boy is Richard a dick sometimes, but you can get through this hell you call existence, but with help you may call this heaven. Keep existing for me if nothing else."
Not even rock bottom is solid ground.,"Rock bottom is as solid as you want it to be....

All of that really sucks..I have no idea what it must be like carrying that around. But none of these events define what job you're capable of or the relationships you're going have. They're events that happened and shitty people. 

Just the fact that you can write in coherent sentences and articulate your thoughts makes you decent in my book. But this post makes me wonder what being a decent person is in your book? You seem like a strong and not taking this shit any longer type of person. Keep on interviewing! Rooting for you"

"27m unemployed, single, suicidal",Have you ever talked to your parents about any of this? Do you think they would be supportive?
"27m unemployed, single, suicidal","The first step is opening up like you have here but to a therapist and/or to your parents who will be disappointed about school but would rather see you get back on track than worse off than you are. They will find out about you not going to school eventually, and would probably rather hear it from you than anything else. For your diagnoses, I highly recommend therapy and whatever other treatments work for you (mainly meaning medication but that's not for everyone)."

I just want to say that I feel you on almost every bit of this, I wish I could tell you stuff to motivate you but I really can‚Äôt because I‚Äôm at my lowest too.

I left class early because no one wanted to partner up with me,"I'm so sorry for how you feel right now, it'a tough. It really is. Nothing much I can say... If you think you can pass, then do it, make this sacrifice and make your dad proud of you. Honk honk."
